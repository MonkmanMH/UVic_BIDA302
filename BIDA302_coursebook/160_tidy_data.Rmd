## Transform Data 3: changing the layout

In the dataframes we have used so far, the data is in a format that adheres to the rules of tidy data, where

- each column is a variable
- each row is an observation
- each value has its own cell

>This is called a "long" data format. But, we notice that each column represents a different variable. In the "longest" data format there would only be three columns, one for the id variable, one for the observed variable, and one for the observed value (of that variable). This data format is quite unsightly and difficult to work with, so you will rarely see it in use.

>Alternatively, in a "wide" data format we see modifications to rule 1, where each column no longer represents a single variable. Instead, columns can represent different levels/values of a variable. For instance, in some data you encounter the researchers may have chosen for every survey date to be a different column.

>These may sound like dramatically different data layouts, but there are some tools that make transitions between these layouts much simpler than you might think! The gif below shows how these two formats relate to each other, and gives you an idea of how we can use R to shift from one format to the other.

(From the Data Carpentry lesson [_R for Social Scientists_, "Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr"](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/03-dplyr-tidyr/index.html)—this lesson provides a different example of using {tidyr} to reshape your data.)

The image below shows the relationship between the two versions of the same data:[@AdenBuie_tidyanimated]

The "wide" form doesn't adhere to the rules of tidy data, since each row has multiple observations.



![](static/img/tidyr-pivot_wider_longer.gif)

Let's create a pivot table crosstab using the {mpg} data package of automobile fuel economy.

First, a look at the source table.

```{r}
mpg

```


Use `group_by` and `summarise` to create a summary table of the average engine displacement:

```{r}
mpg %>%                                
  group_by(class) %>%                   
  summarise(displ_mean = mean(displ)) 

```



Now do the same with vehicle class and number of cylinders:

```{r}

class_by_cyl <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class, cyl) %>%
  summarise(displ_mean = mean(displ)) %>%
  arrange(desc(displ_mean))

class_by_cyl

```


### `pivot_wider()`

Let's take that table and arrange it so that the number of cylinders is the column:


```{r}

# pivot table (wide)

class_by_cyl_pivot <- class_by_cyl %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = cyl, values_from = displ_mean)

class_by_cyl_pivot


```


### `pivot_longer()`

Now, unpivot it back to the original structure:

```{r}
# and back to longer...

displ_class_by_cyl <- class_by_cyl_pivot %>%
  pivot_longer(-class, names_to = "cyl", values_to = "displ_mean")

displ_class_by_cyl

```

What do you notice about the structure of the unpivoted table?



### `spread()` and `gather()` 

Note that `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` are new functions, introduced in 2019.

The older {tidyr} functions that do the same thing: `spread()` and `gather()`. You may find older articles that use these functions...but the new ones are much better!

For example, `spread()` to replicate the `pivot_wider()` function:

```{r}

class_by_cyl %>%
  spread(cyl, value = displ_mean)

```

## Take aways

* Restructure data tabulations with `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer`

## Exercise

[Transform data](https://monkmanmh.shinyapps.io/BIDA302_1-2_transform_data/#section-transform-data-1a-manipulate-cases)

* This exercise gives you an opportunity to practice your {dplyr} and {tidyr} skills

* this article uses the old {tidyr} `gather()` and `spread()` functions instead of `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, but it's got some good material on how to think about how and why data needs to be reshaped.

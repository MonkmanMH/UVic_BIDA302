## Introduction


On 2016-11-18, [Dr. Tammy Schirle](https://legacy.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=1805&f_id=31) posted [a series of tweets](https://twitter.com/tammyschirle/status/799616596750831616) via her twitter account (@tammyschirle), showing the proportion of Canadian women with young children, employed and at work, from 1976-2015.

For this project, you will recreate your own version of this chart (note that the variables are slightly different than what's shown). Then, once you have completed the Canada version, make a second version using British Columbia data.

### Resources


There are a number of good introductory resources for using Python in data science. Here's a short list; unfortunately, there's not as much freely available content in the Python ecosystem:^[And if you're looking for a longer list, [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kareem_carr/status/1374027467829227520?s=20) is a good start!]

#### other resources

I've been compiling a list of other resources that I used to understand how to tackle data science problems in Python. While the basic "this is how Python works / is different than R" things remain relevant, some of the other materials are outdated. I'll leave them here, should you wish to review them:

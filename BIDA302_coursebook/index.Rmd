_Draft_

This book is based on the lessons for BIDA302, "Data Analytics Coding Fundamentals", offered at the University of Victoria's Continuing Studies Department.


## Course description {-}

From [UVic Continuing Studies website](https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/business-technology-and-public-relations/courses/data-analytics-coding-fundamentals)

> This course will explore the fundamentals of coding and scripting for Data Analytics. You will develop the ability to script and code for basic tasks in Data Analytics in common data analytic tools such as R, Python, and Excel. This will allow you to import and export data appropriately and perform fundamental data manipulations and to automate basic analysis elements.

Note that the emphasis of the course will be learning R. The concepts learned in that programming language can be applied in others; we will explore similar functions in Python towards the end of the course.

### Learning objectives {-}

BIDA302 learning objectives:

>By the end of this course, you should be able to:
>
>* Perform basic data manipulations
>
>* Create variables
>
>* Apply key concepts of variables, constants and functions
>
>* Calculate descriptive statistics
>
>* Perform basic logical formula functions
>
>* Group and ungroup data
>
>* Data Importing
>
>* Data Exporting
>
>* Extract and combine data
>
>* Create what-if scenarios


## Meta outcomes {-}

### 1: using **R** {-}

Programming environment designed for statistical analysis / data science 

* Focus on one tool, so you get good at that

### 2: principles  {-}

Concepts and practices that you can carry through to data analysis in other environments

* will have examples of coding in Excel and Python



## Text books and other readings {-}

In addition to the material in this ebook, the text book for this course is Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, _R for Data Science_ [@Wickham_Grolemund2016]. While _R for Data Science_ is available in paper form, it also exists as a freely available online text at [r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

## Code of Conduct {-}

(From the [R Consortium and R Community Code of Conduct](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct))

This class,

> like the R community as a whole, is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth.

Please 

>follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep R a positive, successful, and growing community.

>**R Community Code of Conduct**
>
>A member of the R Community is:
>
>**Open**: Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on projects, working groups, packages, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of anyone who wishes to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where all can participate and everyone can make a difference.
>
>**Considerate**: Members of the community are considerate of their peers — other R users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that oftentimes the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
>
>**Respectful**: Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the R community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
>
>Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.




## Pep Talk! {-}

"Smart people ask stupid questions." (Source unknown)

Any language, computer or human, can be a challenge to learn. We bring our established ways of thinking, and another language won't always conform to those ideas. For example, French has gendered nouns—for example, _le pot_ (pot or drink) and _la peau_ (skin)—and English does not. For an English-speaker, this can be frustrating!

One of the most important developers of R packages (and co-author of our textbook), Hadley Wickham, was recently [quoted in an interview](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

>**It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated.** I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

### Some advice from people who took BIDA302 before... {-}

People who have previously taken this course were asked, mid-way through their studies, "Imagine that time travel is possible...You have just been transported back four weeks to the day before this course started. What is one thing you would tell your past self about this course?" Here's some of their answers:

* It won’t be as scary as you think it will be.

* You’ll get better soon.

* Need to spend more time studying since the class is 6 hours a week, 1-2 hours a week outside class won’t be enough for a dinosaur like me.

* To do the homework on Saturday after class so you haven’t forgotten everything!

* **Reading the textbook will help you, use it.**

  - Review the data before starting to work with it. It helps to understand what the data is, how it might be used.

  - Review the material in the Saturday lesson as you will need it for the assignment.

  - If you start having to use functions you aren’t familiar with, you’re on the wrong track.

  - Keep it simple, and then add on as you go.

* Prepare to learn lots about R and RStudio. …And bring coffee!

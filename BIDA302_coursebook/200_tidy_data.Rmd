## Transform Data 3: changing the layout

### Tidy and untidy data

In the dataframes we have used so far, the data is in a format that adheres to the rules of tidy data, where

- each column is a variable
- each row is an observation
- each value has its own cell

>This is called a "long" data format. But, we notice that each column represents a different variable. In the "longest" data format there would only be three columns, one for the id variable, one for the observed variable, and one for the observed value (of that variable). This data format is quite unsightly and difficult to work with, so you will rarely see it in use.

>Alternatively, in a "wide" data format we see modifications to rule 1, where each column no longer represents a single variable. Instead, columns can represent different levels/values of a variable. For instance, in some data you encounter the researchers may have chosen for every survey date to be a different column.

>These may sound like dramatically different data layouts, but there are some tools that make transitions between these layouts much simpler than you might think! The gif below shows how these two formats relate to each other, and gives you an idea of how we can use R to shift from one format to the other.

(From the Data Carpentry lesson [_R for Social Scientists_, "Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr"](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/03-dplyr-tidyr/index.html)—this lesson provides a different example of using {tidyr} to reshape your data.)

The image below shows the relationship between the two versions of the same data:[@AdenBuie_tidyanimated]

The "wide" form doesn't adhere to the rules of tidy data, since each row has multiple observations.

> Untidy data most often look like this:
> * Column headers are values, not variable names.
> * Multiple variables are stored in one column.
> * Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
> * Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
> * A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

### An example

Let's create a pivot table crosstab using the {mpg} data package of automobile fuel economy.

First, a look at the source table.

```{r}
mpg

```


Use `group_by` and `summarise` to create a summary table of the average engine displacement:

```{r}
mpg %>%                                
  group_by(class) %>%                   
  summarise(displ_mean = mean(displ)) 

```



Now do the same with vehicle class and number of cylinders:

```{r}

class_by_cyl <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class, cyl) %>%
  summarise(displ_mean = mean(displ)) %>%
  arrange(desc(displ_mean))

class_by_cyl

```


### `pivot_wider()`

Let's take that table and arrange it so that the number of cylinders is the column:


```{r}

# pivot table (wide)

class_by_cyl_pivot <- class_by_cyl %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = cyl, values_from = displ_mean)

class_by_cyl_pivot


```


### `pivot_longer()`

Now, unpivot it back to the original structure:

```{r}
# and back to longer...

displ_class_by_cyl <- class_by_cyl_pivot %>%
  pivot_longer(-class, names_to = "cyl", values_to = "displ_mean")

displ_class_by_cyl

```

What do you notice about the structure of the unpivoted table?



### `spread()` and `gather()` 

Note that `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` are new functions, introduced in 2019.

The older {tidyr} functions that do the same thing: `spread()` and `gather()`. You may find older articles that use these functions...but the new ones are much better!

For example, `spread()` to replicate the `pivot_wider()` function:

```{r}

class_by_cyl %>%
  spread(cyl, value = displ_mean)

```

## Take aways

* Restructure data tabulations with `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer`

## Exercises

### Hands-on exercise


Create a table that shows:

* GDP per capita for
* the countries Canada, United States, and Mexico are the columns, and 
* the years after 1980 are the rows

```{r}
# solution #1
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Canada", "United States", "Germany") &
           year > 1980) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = gdpPercap)

# a similar solution that uses "or" for the countries
# and two separate filter statements
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada" | country == "United States" | country == "Mexico") %>% 
  filter(year > 1980) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = gdpPercap)

```

Here's an alternative approach that avoids the use of the `select()` function.

Note that by adding `year` to the `pivot_wider()` all the variables in the final table are explicitly named in the function.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada" | country == "United States" | country == "Mexico") %>% 
  filter(year > 1980) %>% 
  pivot_wider(year, 
              names_from = "country", 
              values_from = "gdpPercap")

```

In this version, the three variables `continent`, `lifeExp`, and `pop` are dropped with the minus sign—the remaining variables are then reshaped.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada" | country == "United States" | country == "Mexico") %>% 
  filter(year > 1980) %>% 
  pivot_wider(c(-continent, -lifeExp, -pop), 
              names_from = "country", 
              values_from = "gdpPercap")

```

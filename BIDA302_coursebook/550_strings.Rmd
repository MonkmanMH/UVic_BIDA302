## Strings: introduction {#strings-intro}

For this exercise, we will be using the tidyverse package {stringr}. Note that {stringr} is part of the tidyverse, but not a core package that loads with {tidyverse} (like {lubridate}), so it has to be loaded separately.


```{r}

library(tidyverse)
#
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
# to use `str_view()` 
library(htmlwidgets)

```


Strings are characters, numbers, etc. that are enclosed inside quotation marks. A character vector is made up of multiple strings.

```{r}

string1 <- "This is my 1st string!"

string1

```

## Regular expressions {#strings-regex}

**reg**ular **ex**pressions becomes shortened to "regex"

> regexps are a concise language for describing patterns in strings

They are powerful ways to filter and manipulate strings based on those patterns. But they have a certain reputation:

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. 
– Jamie Zawinski




### regex matching functions

Here are some basic matching functions:

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "abc" | matches "abc" |
| "[a][b][c]" | matches "abc" |
| "[abc]" | matches "a", "b", or "c" |
| "[^abc]" | matches anything _except_ "a", "b", or "c" |
| "^" | match start of string |
| "$" | match end of string |


The {stringr} function `str_view()` shows where in our string the pattern appears. First we create an object "fruit_list" with three strings in it, then find two different patterns.

```{r}
fruit_list <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")

# which words start with "a"?
str_view(fruit_list, "^a")
```


```{r}

# which words have an "ea" combination?

str_view(fruit_list, "ea")

```

### Your turn {#strings-yourturn_1}

Which words end with "a"?

```{r}
# solution
str_view(fruit_list, "a$")

```


frequency of match

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "?" | 0 or 1 |
| "+" | 1 or more |
| "*" | 0 or more |


The question mark is useful for words with various spellings—the British and American variations of words like "colour" and "neighbour".

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "{n}" | exactly n times |
| "{n,}" | n or more |
| "{n,m}" | between n and m times |


```{r}
# which words have a double "p"?

str_view(fruit_list, "p{2}")

```


## Special characters {#strings-special}

**quotes**

To find single and double quotes in our string, they need to be "escaped" with a backslash `\`

```{r}

double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"

double_quote
single_quote

```


* to see a representation of the string as it will print, use the function `writeLines()`

```{r}

writeLines(double_quote)

```



```{r}

string2 <- 'The 2nd string has a "quote" so it is inside single quotes'

string2

writeLines(string2)

```


**other special characters**

These also need to be escaped:

| character | what it is |
| ---- | ---- |
| "\\" | backslash |
| "\d" | any digit |
| "\n" | newline (line break) |
| "\s" | any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
| "\t" | tab |
| "\u..." | unicode characters* |


* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters

See the help function for `?'"'`

```{r}
interrobang <- "\u2048"
interrobang

```


To make a shruggie, you need to escape the backslash

```{r}

shruggie <- "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
shruggie

shruggie <- glue::glue("¯\\", "_(ツ)_", "/¯")
shruggie

```





## Basic functions {#strings-basic}
 

![stringr hex](static/img_tidyverse/stringr_400.png)


{stringr} functions 

| function | purpose |
| ---- | ---- |
| str_length(x)  | the number of characters in `x` |
| str_c() | concatenates a list of strings |
| str_sub(x, start = , end = ) | returns characters of `x` |
| str_detect(x, pattern) | TRUE/FALSE if there is a pattern match |
| str_replace(x, pattern, newtext | replace |




```{r string_length}

musician_first <- c("Sly", "Billie", "Thelonious", "Maroon", "Willie", "Led")
musician_first
str_length(musician_first) 

```


use `str_c` to collapse list into one string

```{r str_c}

str_c(musician_first, collapse = ", ")

```


## Combining strings {#strings-combining}

Use `str_c` to join two character vectors, separated by a space


```{r str_c_2}


musician_last <- c("Stone", "Ellish", "Monk", "5", "Nelson", "Zeppelin")

str_c(musician_first, musician_last, sep = " ")

```

### Your turn {#strings-yourturn2}

Now join `musician_first` to `musician_last` (the other way around!), separated by an apostrophe and a space

```{r your_turn_2.1}

#solution
str_c(musician_last, musician_first, sep = ", ")


```


## Pattern matching {#strings-pattern}

### Your turn {#strings-yourturn3}

Are there any vowels in the string `musician_first`? Use `str_detect()`

And count them with `str_count()`:

```{r str_count}
# solution
str_detect(musician_first, "[aeiou]")

str_count(musician_first, "[aeiou]")

```

Are there any digits in `musician_last`? (Don't forget that you need to escape any backslashes you use!)

```{r}
# solution
str_detect(musician_last, "\\d")

```




Extract chunks of text by their location: `str_sub(musician_first, start, end)`


```{r str_sub}
# solution
str_sub(musician_first, 1, 2)  


```


`str_locate()` finds the first position of the pattern:

```{r}

# look for pairs of vowels
str_locate(musician_first, "[aeiou][aeiou]")

# look for a specific match ...
str_locate(musician_first, "oo")

```


Extract the first case of a vowel:

```{r}

str_extract(musician_first, "[aeiou]")

```


Extract the pairs of vowels:

```{r}
# solution
str_extract(musician_first, "[aeiou][aeiou]")

# alternate solution
str_extract(musician_first, "[aeiou]{2}")


```


### Filtering on patterns {#strings-filtering}

Filter by country that has "land" in the name

```{r}

gapminder <- gapminder::gapminder 

gapminder %>% 
  filter(str_detect(country, "land")) %>% 
  distinct(country)

```

What about those countries where "land" is at the end of the name?

```{r}

gapminder %>% 
  filter(str_detect(country, "land$")) %>% 
  distinct(country)

```

Or those where "land" is at the end and is preceded by only three letters?

```{r}

pattern_string <- "^\\w{3}land$"

gapminder %>% 
  filter(str_detect(country, pattern_string)) %>% 
  distinct(country)


```



### Selecting on patterns  {#strings-selecting}

Earlier, we covered the {dplyr} function to `select()` variables (columns) in a data frame.

Here's some tools to make that selection process a bit more streamlined:


| function | tool |
| ---      | --- |
| `starts_with()` | Starts with a prefix |
| `ends_with()` | Ends with a suffix |
| `contains()` |  Contains a literal string | 
| `matches()` | Matches a regular expression |



(Note: these functions are some of the "select_helpers" imported into {dplyr} from the [{tidyselect}](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyselect/versions/1.0.0/topics/select_helpers) package. )

Examples using the {iris} data:

```{r}

head(iris)

```

Here is a way to select the variables that have the length measurements:

```{r}
iris %>% 
  select(contains("Length")) %>%
  head()
```

And two ways to select those with the petal measurements:

```{r}
iris %>% 
  select(starts_with("Pet")) %>%
  head()
```

This second case incorporates regex into the selection code, with the "^" for the start of the string:

```{r}
iris %>% 
  select(matches("^P")) %>%
  head()
```



## Splitting strings {#strings-splitting}

https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_split.html

function: `str_split()`


Back to the various ways dates are represented: if it's a character string with the month and year.

"Jan 2019"

```{r}

our_date <- "Jan 2019"


lubridate::ymd(our_date)


```

So that doesn't work.

We can split the string into two parts using `str_split()`, where we specify the space as the splitting element:

```{r}

str_split(our_date, " ")

```

Here we have four month-years, arranged alphabetically:

```{r}

four_dates <- tribble(~ref_date, "Dec 2019", "Feb 2020", "Jan 2018", "Mar 2021")

four_dates <- four_dates %>% 
  mutate(value = 1:4)

four_dates

```

Inside a tibble, we use `separate()` from the {tidyr} package:

* https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html

```{r}

four_dates2 <- four_dates %>% 
  separate(ref_date, into = c("ref_mon", "ref_year"), sep = " ")

four_dates2

```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6549239/convert-months-mmm-to-numeric


Back to factors!

```{r}

# create a list that will be the month levels:

month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)


four_dates3 <- four_dates2 %>% 
  mutate(ref_mon2 = factor(ref_mon, levels = month_levels)) %>%
  arrange(ref_mon2)

four_dates3

```


```{r}

four_dates_list <- four_dates3 %>% 
  glue::glue_data("{ref_year}-{ref_mon2}-01")

four_dates_list

```


Now it's in a format that {lubridate} can understand, and convert to a <date> class:

```{r}


ymd(four_dates_list)

```


And here's three different ways to add our new list back onto the data table:

```{r list_into_table}
# in a pipe:
four_dates3 %>% 
  mutate(ref_date_x = ymd(four_dates_list))

# for fans of the <table>$<variable> structure:
four_dates3$ref_date_y <- ymd(four_dates_list)

# and a new function, `cbind()`:
cbind(four_dates3, ymd(four_dates_list))

```

```{r}

a_to_j <- letters[1:10]

typeof(a_to_j)
length(a_to_j)


a_to_j_string <- stringr::str_c(letters[1:10], collapse = ", ")

typeof(a_to_j_string)
length(a_to_j_string)

commas <- function(...) {
  stringr:::str_c(..., collapse = ", ")
}

commas(letters[11:20])
  
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

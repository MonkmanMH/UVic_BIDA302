## Strings: introduction {#strings-intro}

For this exercise, we will be using the tidyverse package {stringr}. Note that {stringr} is part of the tidyverse, but not a core package that loads with {tidyverse} (like {lubridate}), so it has to be loaded separately.


```{r}

library(tidyverse)
#
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
# to use `str_view()` 
library(htmlwidgets)

```


Strings are characters, numbers, etc. that are enclosed inside quotation marks. A character vector is made up of multiple strings.

```{r}

string1 <- "This is my 1st string!"

string1

```

## Regular expressions {#strings-regex}

**reg**ular **ex**pressions becomes shortened to "regex"

> regexps are a concise language for describing patterns in strings

They are powerful ways to filter and manipulate strings based on those patterns. But they have a certain reputation:

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. 
– Jamie Zawinski




### regex matching functions

Here are some basic matching functions:

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "abc" | matches "abc" |
| "[a][b][c]" | matches "abc" |
| "[abc]" | matches "a", "b", or "c" |
| "[^abc]" | matches anything _except_ "a", "b", or "c" |
| "^" | match start of string |
| "$" | match end of string |


The {stringr} function `str_view()` shows where in our string the pattern appears. First we create an object "fruit_list" with three strings in it, then find two different patterns.

```{r}
fruit_list <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")

# which words start with "a"?
str_view(fruit_list, "^a")
```


```{r}

# which words have an "ea" combination?

str_view(fruit_list, "ea")

```


::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn {#strings-yourturn_1}


Use `count` to check that `planes$tailnum` is a primary key


<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>

Which words end with "a"?

```{r}
# solution
str_view(fruit_list, "a$")

```


</details>
:::


frequency of match

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "?" | 0 or 1 |
| "+" | 1 or more |
| "*" | 0 or more |


The question mark is useful for words with various spellings—the British and American variations of words like "colour" and "neighbour".

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "{n}" | exactly n times |
| "{n,}" | n or more |
| "{n,m}" | between n and m times |


```{r}
# which words have a double "p"?

str_view(fruit_list, "p{2}")

```


## Special characters {#strings-special}

**quotes**

To find single and double quotes in our string, they need to be "escaped" with a backslash `\`

```{r}

double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"

double_quote
single_quote

```


* to see a representation of the string as it will print, use the function `writeLines()`

```{r}

writeLines(double_quote)

```



```{r}

string2 <- 'The 2nd string has a "quote" so it is inside single quotes'

string2

writeLines(string2)

```


**other special characters**

These also need to be escaped:

| character | what it is |
| ---- | ---- |
| "\\" | backslash |
| "\d" | any digit |
| "\n" | newline (line break) |
| "\s" | any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
| "\t" | tab |
| "\*" | asterisk |
| "\u..." | unicode characters* |


* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters

See the help function for `?'"'`

```{r}
interrobang <- "\u2048"
interrobang

```


To make a shruggie, you need to escape the backslash

```{r}

shruggie <- "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
shruggie

shruggie <- glue::glue("¯\\", "_(ツ)_", "/¯")
shruggie

```





## Basic functions {#strings-basic}
 

![stringr hex](static/img_tidyverse/stringr_400.png){width=25%}


Some {stringr} functions 

| function | purpose |
| ---- | ---- |
| str_length(x)  | the number of characters in `x` |
| str_c() | concatenates a list of strings |
| str_sub(x, start = , end = ) | returns characters of `x` |
| str_detect(string, pattern) | TRUE/FALSE if there is a pattern match |
| str_replace(string, pattern, newtext) | replace |
| str_remove(string, pattern) | removes the first instance of `pattern` |
| str_remove_all (string, pattern) | removes all instances of `pattern` |
| str_trim (string) | removes whitespace at the beginning and end |

The full list of {stringr} functions can be found at https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html


```{r string_length}

musician_first <- c("Sly", "Billie", "Thelonious", "Maroon", "Willie", "Led")
musician_first
str_length(musician_first) 

```


use `str_c` to collapse list into one string

```{r str_c}

str_c(musician_first, collapse = ", ")

```


## Combining strings {#strings-combining}

Use `str_c` to join two character vectors, separated by a space


```{r str_c_2}


musician_last <- c("Stone", "Ellish", "Monk", "5", "Nelson", "Zeppelin")

str_c(musician_first, musician_last, sep = " ")

```

::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn  {#strings-yourturn2}



Now join `musician_first` to `musician_last` (the other way around!), separated by an apostrophe and a space

<summary>
Solution
</summary>



```{r your_turn_2.1}

#solution
str_c(musician_last, musician_first, sep = ", ")


```



</details>
:::


## Pattern matching {#strings-pattern}


::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn  {#strings-yourturn3}



Are there any vowels in the string `musician_first`? 

Use `str_detect()` to find them, and count them with `str_count()`.


<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


```{r str_count}
# solution
str_detect(musician_first, "[aeiou]")

str_count(musician_first, "[aeiou]")

```


</details>
:::



::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn  {#strings-yourturn4}




Are there any digits in `musician_last`?

<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>

Don't forget that you need to escape any backslashes you use!


```{r}
# solution
str_detect(musician_last, "\\d")

```




</details>
:::


We can extract chunks of text by their location using the following function: `str_sub(musician_first, start, end)`


```{r str_sub}
# solution
str_sub(musician_first, 1, 2)  


```


`str_locate()` finds the first position of the pattern:

```{r}

# look for pairs of vowels
str_locate(musician_first, "[aeiou][aeiou]")

# look for a specific match ...
str_locate(musician_first, "oo")

```


Extract the first case of a vowel:

```{r}

str_extract(musician_first, "[aeiou]")

```


Extract the pairs of vowels:

```{r}
# solution
str_extract(musician_first, "[aeiou][aeiou]")

# alternate solution
str_extract(musician_first, "[aeiou]{2}")


```


### Filtering on patterns {#strings-filtering}

Filter by country that has "land" in the name

```{r}

gapminder <- gapminder::gapminder 

gapminder %>% 
  filter(str_detect(country, "land")) %>% 
  distinct(country)

```

What about those countries where "land" is at the end of the name?

```{r}

gapminder %>% 
  filter(str_detect(country, "land$")) %>% 
  distinct(country)

```

Or those where "land" is at the end and is preceded by only three letters?

```{r}

pattern_string <- "^\\w{3}land$"

gapminder %>% 
  filter(str_detect(country, pattern_string)) %>% 
  distinct(country)


```



### Selecting on patterns  {#strings-selecting}

Earlier, we covered the {dplyr} function to `select()` variables (columns) in a data frame.

Here's some tools to make that selection process a bit more streamlined:


| function | tool |
| ---      | --- |
| `starts_with()` | Starts with a prefix |
| `ends_with()` | Ends with a suffix |
| `contains()` |  Contains a literal string | 
| `matches()` | Matches a regular expression |



(Note: these functions are some of the "select_helpers" imported into {dplyr} from the [{tidyselect}](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyselect/versions/1.0.0/topics/select_helpers) package. )

Examples using the {palmerpenguins} data:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins)

```

Here is a way to select the variables that have the length measurements:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(contains("length")) %>%
  head()
```

And two ways to select those with the bill measurements:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(starts_with("bill_")) %>%
  head()
```

This second case incorporates regex into the selection code, with the "^" for the start of the string:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(matches("^b")) %>%
  head()
```


## Cleaning strings {#strings-cleaning}

### Removing characters {#strings-removing}

In the Week 3 assignment, you probably noticed that some of the community names have a pair of asterisks at the end, indicating that the community includes more than one municipality. For example, "North Vancouver" includes both the City of North Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver (two distinct towns, with the same name...) 

Here's a long form of the "Purpose Built Rental" sheet ("pbr" for short) from that Excel file:

```{r}

housing1_long <- read_csv("data/bc-stats_2018-new-homes-data_PBR.csv")
housing1_long

```

If we plot the top 10 municipalities (remember the `slice()` function!), we see that North Vancouver shows up...complete with the two asterisks.



```{r}

ggplot(housing1_long %>% 
  group_by(community) %>% 
  tally(units, sort = TRUE, name = "3 Year Total") %>% 
  slice(1:10), aes(x = reorder(community, `3 Year Total`), y = `3 Year Total`))+
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

```

We can use our knowledge of regular expressions and the functions in {stringr} to remove these. The first thing we need to recall is that an asterisk is one of those [Special characters]{strings-special}, and we need to "escape" it with a backslash, and we need to escape the first backslash too. Here's an example:

```{r}

city_name <- "North Vancouver**"

# detect the presence of an asterisk
str_detect(city_name, "\\*")


# detect the presence of an asterisk
str_count(city_name, "\\*")

```


{stringr} provides us functions for this very task: 

* `str_remove()` removes the first instance it finds, and 

* `str_remove_all()` removes all of them.

* https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_remove.html


In a pipe with our dataframe, it would look like this:

```{r}
housing1_long <- housing1_long %>% 
  mutate(community = str_remove_all(community, "\\*"))

```

Let's filter for North Vancouver to check the success of our efforts:


```{r}
housing1_long %>% 
  filter(community == "North Vancouver")
```

What? Where are those rows? If we do a visual inspection, they are there. It turns out that there is a blank space between the community name and the asterisks. 

There's another {stringr} function for this: `str_trim()`.

* https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_trim.html

```{r}
housing1_long <- housing1_long %>% 
  mutate(community = str_trim(community))

housing1_long %>% 
  filter(community == "North Vancouver")

```

* `str_trim()` has an argument `side =` if you need to specify left, right, or (the default) both

* there is also a function `str_squish()` that also takes out excess whitespace (it still does leading and trailing, like `str_trim()`)

* and if you need to _add_ whitespace, there's `str_pad()`

* 


Now our plot will have clean names:

```{r}

ggplot(housing1_long %>% 
  group_by(community) %>% 
  tally(units, sort = TRUE, name = "3 Year Total") %>% 
  slice(1:10), aes(x = reorder(community, `3 Year Total`), y = `3 Year Total`))+
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()


```








### Splitting strings {#strings-splitting}

This file has a single column, with both the name of every electoral district in British Columbia, preceded by a three-letter abbreviation (TLA).

```{r}

bced <- read_csv("data/bc_electoral_districts_2015.txt", col_names = FALSE)
bced

```

You'll notice that in this file the three letter abbreviation is separated by "\\t". This is the regular expression for a tab.

From {stringr}, we can use the `str_split()` function:

* https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_split.html



```{r}

head(str_split(bced$X1, "\t"))

```

But there's a solution designed for tabular data, in the {tidyr} package: `separate()`

* https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html


```{r}
bced %>% 
  separate(X1, "\t", into = c("ed_tla", "ed_name"))

```

If we add the `remove = ` argument set to `FALSE`, the original variable remains:

```{r}
bced %>% 
  separate(X1, "\t", into = c("ed_tla", "ed_name"), remove = FALSE)

```


In the above example, the tab symbol is the separator, and there's only one per line. But what if the abbreviation and the name were separated by spaces? In that case, we would want to separate on only the first space.

```{r}

bced_space <- read_csv("data/bc_electoral_districts_2015_space.txt", col_names = FALSE)
bced_space
```

```{r}

bced_space %>% 
  separate(X1, " ", into = c("ed_tla", "ed_name"))


```

For the electoral districts with only a single word or a hyphen, it works fine. But notice that the two Abbotsford ridings are now just "Abbotsford", since everything after the second space has been dropped.

The solution is to use the `extra = "merge"` argument. (Note that the default is `extra = "drop"`.)



```{r}

bced_space %>% 
  separate(X1, " ", into = c("ed_tla", "ed_name"), extra = "merge")


```

Nice!

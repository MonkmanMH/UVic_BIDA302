# Factors {#factors}



## Objectives

* Understand how factor type variables differ from character strings.

* Understand how to manipulate factors.

* Produce bar charts and other categorical plots using {ggplot2}.

* Set universal plot settings.
 
* Extend learning of {ggplot2} functions.


## Setup

This chunk of R code loads the packages that we will be using.


```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(forcats)  # note that {forcats} isn't part of the core tidyverse so has to be loaded explicitly
```


## Categorical variables: factors

We love factors. We hate factors. 

Factors make working with categorical variables a breeze: you can sort them or arrange them arbitrarily (think days of the week), 

But there are some traps that you might fall into, if you're not careful.

The package {forcats} is _very_ helpful. 


### Factor functions

Base R functions for working with factors

| function | purpose |
| :-- | :-- |
| `str` | display structure of object |
| `class` | returns the class of an object |
| `levels` | returns the values of the levels |
| `nlevels` | return the number of levels |



::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn

Use the functions in the table above to examine the `continent` variable in the gapminder dataset.

<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>




```{r}

str(gapminder$continent)

class(gapminder$continent)

# this is an important one!
levels(gapminder$continent)

nlevels(gapminder$continent)


```



</details>
:::



::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn



Use the `count()` function in a pipe to get a frequency table of each level in the factors in the `continent` variable



<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


```{r}
# solution
gapminder |>
  count(continent)

```



</details>
:::


### Dropping levels

A key thing to remember is that the factor levels exist separate from your data ... even if you filter the data, the factor levels stay the same unless you drop the extras.

In this example, we see that there are 142 countries in `gapminder` -- and if you filter the `gapminder` data down to 4, there are still 142 levels associated with `country`.

Leaving them in can cause problems, for instance when you try to plot them all.


```{r}

nlevels(gapminder$country)

h_countries <- c("Belgium", "India", "Denmark", "Albania")  # see what I did there?

h_gap <- gapminder |>
  filter(country %in% h_countries)

nlevels(h_gap$country)

```



The function we need here is `droplevels()`.


::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn


Use the `droplevels()` function to delete the levels that are unused. 


<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


```{r}

h_gap <- gapminder |>
  filter(country %in% h_countries) |> 
  droplevels()

```

After you filter the gapminder data table to include just the 4 countries in the `h_countries` list, the `droplevels()` function can be run next in the pipe--the other 138 levels are dropped. 

We can then use `levels()` and `nlevels()` to check the results.

```{r}
levels(h_gap$country)

nlevels(h_gap$country)

```



</details>
:::




### Changing the order of the factors

As you can see with our country names above, the default arrangement is alphabetical. This is fine in some applications, but as we will see when we plot the data, we might want to sort them by another variable.



#### Arranging levels 

We might want to sort levels in an arbitrary way. 

For example, our short country list would be more entertaining if it spelled out "BIDA".

Here's the way the levels are arranged:

```{r}

h_gap$country |> 
  levels()

```


We can use `fct_relevel()` to change some or all of the levels.

```{r}

h_gap$country |>
  fct_relevel("Belgium", "India", "Denmark", "Albania") |> 
  levels()

```




What if we want to sort by the number of countries in each continent, that is, the number of times each factor occurs?

`fct_infreq()` is what we need, or `fct_infreq() |> fct_rev()` for backwards.



::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn


Give `fct_infreq()` a try on `continent` in gapminder.


<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


```{r}
# solutions
gapminder$continent |>
  fct_infreq() |>
  levels()


gapminder$continent |>
  fct_infreq() |>
  fct_rev() |>
  levels()

```

In a pipe where we are using the entire data frame, it would look like this:

```{r}

gmind <- gapminder |>
  # sort the factors
  mutate(continent = continent |> 
           fct_infreq() |> 
           fct_rev()) 

levels(gmind$continent)

```



</details>
:::




You can also sort by another variable in the data frame. In this example, the countries are sorted by minimum life expectancy.

You can find other ways to sort in [STAT545, "Reorder factors"](https://stat545.com/factors-boss.html#reorder-factors)

```{r}

fct_reorder(gapminder$country, gapminder$lifeExp, min) |>
  levels() |>
  head()


```



Recoding levels is similar to the renaming that's possible in `dplyr::select()`

```{r}
i_gap <- gapminder |> 
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "Sweden", "Australia")) |> 
  droplevels()

i_gap$country |> 
  levels()

i_gap$country |>
  fct_recode("USA" = "United States", "Oz" = "Australia") |> 
  levels()

```




## Plotting categorical variables


Create a dataframe object with the name "gapminder_2007" by filtering the gapminder data.

```{r}

gapminder_2007 <- filter(gapminder, year == 2007)

```



###  Bar plot: countries in each continent


Bar plots are often used to visualize the distribution of a discrete variable. In this case, we will show how many countries there are in each continent.

* the **geom** is `geom_bar`

* map the `x` variable to `continent`

* there is no `y` variable! {ggplot} will count the number of observations in each category




```{r}
# solution
ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar()

```


Note that `colour` (or `color`) won't work on a bar! That's for points and lines.

For something that occupies a block of space--such as a bar or pie chart--you need to use `fill`.

Add the `fill` attribute to `continent` to the code you wrote above. (Yes, you'll be specifying continent twice!)

```{r}
# solution

ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = continent, fill = `continent`)) +
  geom_bar()

```


This is the default palette. It might be a bit too vibrant for your eyes...don't worry, we will learn to fix that later.



Another {ggplot2} feature is that every plot is an object. If you want to save a basic version of your plot and continue to tinker with it, you can assign that basic version to an object name, and just add to it.

It would look something like:

`mybar <- ggplot() + geom_()`

Followed by

`mybar + `



```{r}
# solution
mybar <- ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = continent, fill = `continent`)) +
  geom_bar()

```



It's possible to turn this on its side, so that the country labels are on the left, and the bars run left-to-right instead of up-and-down.

To do this, add the `coord_flip()` function to the chart object you assigned above (you might have called it `mybar`).




```{r}
# solution
mybar + coord_flip()

```


### Sorting factors in a plot

To sort the factors in a plot, we first mutate the variable that contains the factor variable that will plot.

In this example, we use the same code that we saw in hands-on 3.3, Your Turn 3.2. Other sort functions (such as `fct_relevel`) could also be used. 

```{r}
gapminder |>
  # sort the factors
  mutate(continent = continent |> 
           fct_infreq() |> 
           fct_rev()) |> 
  # then plot
  ggplot(aes(x = continent)) +
    geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()

```

A generic version of the sorting using `fct_rev()` to put them in reverse order is here:

`df |> mutate(my_fct = fct_rev(my_fct) |> ggplot(…)`






In this example, we will plot the four countries in our BIDA group by life expectancy.

```{r}
h_countries <- c("Belgium", "India", "Denmark", "Albania")  # see what I did there?

h_gap <- gapminder |>
  filter(country %in% h_countries) |>
  mutate(country = country |> 
  fct_relevel("Belgium", "India", "Denmark", "Albania"))  

h_gap |>
  filter(year == 2007) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = country, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 6)

```


::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn


Now it's your turn: plot the four countries in our BIDA group by life expectancy.

<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


```{r}
# solution
h_gap |>
  filter(year == 2007) |>
  mutate(country = country |> 
           fct_reorder(lifeExp) |> 
           fct_rev()) |> 
  # now plot
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = country, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 6)


```

## Introduction {#python-intro}


![_the data science process_](static/img/data-science.png)

We have spent 5.5 weeks talking about this process^[From [@Wickham_Grolemund2016]] with **R**...but it's not the only tool set available.

One other data science programming environment that is popular is the programming language Python^[[python.org](https://www.python.org/).]

![_Python logo_](static/img/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png){width=33%}


In our first chapter, you saw the analogy of base R being like the engine and frame of a car & basic controls like the pedals and steering wheel

![VW Beetle frame](static/img/VW_ad_1_crop.png){width=40%}

...the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

* the body, windshield, headlights, A/C, sound system, etc

![_VW Beetle transparent_](static/img/vwlooking.jpg){width=40%}

...and RStudio is the dashboard and controls

![_VW Beetle dashboard_](static/img/VW_dashboard.jpg){width=40%}

Python is a general purpose programming language, so it is like an engine.

It can power a car...or a boat, or a water pump, or ...

![VW Beetle engine](static/img/1965_Volkswagen-Bug-Which-Came-First-Engine_List-L_crop.jpg){width=40%}

Because Python is a general-purpose programming language, there are some key differences.

* Unlike R, Python _doesn't_ have data analysis functions built-in.

* To do data analysis in Python, you need to load the _libraries_ (also known as the _modules_ or _packages_) that are the frame, steering wheel, etc.

The libraries for this are listed below in the [Resources & reference](#python-resources) section.

For those of us who are familiar with R and RStudio, the {reticulate} package gives us an interface to add Python to our toolkit.

![_{reticulate} hex_](static/img_tidyverse/reticulate-735.jpg){width=25%}

> 
> The reticulate package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. The package includes facilities for:
> 
> Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.
> 
> Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).
> 
> Flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments.
> 
> Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!

(from the [{reticulate} site](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/))


Load reticulate:

```{r libraries}
library(reticulate)

```


The {reticulate} function `py_config()` can be used to see what version of Python is running, and other configuration details

```{r, py_config_chunk}
py_config()

```



It's possible to run Python code chunks inside your R Markdown document. 

In this chunk, we have Python code that loads the `pandas` module (for data wrangling) and changes the reference to `pd`.


```{python}
# import the `pandas` module so that it's available for use
import pandas as pd

```

At this point, you may get a warning that pandas is not installed. If that's the case, switch to the "Terminal" tab (next to the Console) and enter the following:

```
python -m pip install pandas

```

This next chunk reads the CSV file "flights.csv" (the `flights` table from {nycflights13})


```{python}


# read the csv file "flights.csv" and assign it to the object "flights"
flights = pd.read_csv("data/flights.csv")

# print the head (first 5 rows)
print(flights.head())

```


Notice a couple of things:

* the read function adds an index column by default; if you have a table where you have an index variable, you can specify that in the `read_csv`

* that index numbering starts at 0 ... watch for that if you start using row references 


## Filter and select {#python-filter}

It's a big table...over 300,000 rows.


So let's trim it down to a bite size chunk, and create a new Python data frame, `flights_SEA`:

```{python}
# python chunk

# filter so that flights contains just those that are going to the 
# Seattle-Tacoma airport SEA
flights_SEA = flights[flights['dest'] == "SEA"]

# select the carrier, departure delay, and arrival delay columns
flights_SEA = flights_SEA[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]

# drop the NAs
flights_SEA = flights_SEA.dropna()

# print the remainer
print(flights_SEA)

```


## Detour: running a Python script inside your RStudio {#python-script}

The chunks above are defined {python} chunks. 

If we have that code in a Python script ".py" file, we can run the same code inside an R chunk.

The original .py file "py_code.py" has the following:

```
# this wrangles the nyc13flights data using pandas

import pandas as pd
flights = pd.read_csv("data/flights.csv")
flights_SEA = flights[flights['dest'] == "SEA"]
flights_SEA = flights_SEA[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights_SEA = flights_SEA.dropna()
print(flights_SEA.head())

```

This R chunk uses the {reticulate} function `source_python()` to call that file:

```{r}
# r chunk that calls a python script file

source_python("py_code.py")

```







## Calculating summary statistics {#python-summarystats}

Count the number of flights by airline: uses `size()`

```{python}
# python chunk

flights_SEA.groupby("carrier").size()

```
* the "dtype" indicates the data type, and "int64" is a 64-bit integer


Mean of departure delay, median of arrival delay.


```{python}
# python chunk

flights_SEA['dep_delay'].mean()


flights_SEA['arr_delay'].median()

```


Another way to go about it would be to select the column as a new object, then calculate.

```{python}
# python chunk

departure_delay = flights_SEA['dep_delay']

departure_delay.mean()

```



pandas also has a `describe` function that produces many summary stats:

```{python}
# python chunk

flights_SEA.describe()

```


## Grouping {#python-grouping}

It's possible to calculate summary statistics by a variable through the `groupby` function.

Here we calculate the mean delays for each airline.

```{python}
# python chunk

flights_SEA.groupby("carrier").mean()

```


The same, but with median.


```{python}
# python chunk

flights_SEA.groupby("carrier").median()

```


## Pivoting {#python-pivoting}

In pandas, the reshaping functions to pivot are:

* longer is `melt`

* wider is `pivot_table`


To create a longer shape:

```{python}
# python chunk

df_melted = pd.melt(flights_SEA, id_vars=["carrier"], value_vars=["dep_delay", "arr_delay"], value_name="delay.time")

print(df_melted)

```




The `pivot_table` function gives another way to calculate grouped statistics. The `index` variable works in the same way as `groupby`.

```{python}
# python chunk

df_pivot = df_melted.pivot_table(index=["carrier"], columns =["variable"], values =["delay.time"])

print(df_pivot)


```


Note that the default statistic here is the mean. We can also specify a different one using the `aggfunc` function:

```{python}
# python chunk

df_pivot = df_melted.pivot_table(index=["carrier"], values =["delay.time"], columns =["variable"], aggfunc='median')

print(df_pivot)


```

Or we can get carried away and have multiple measures:

```{python}
# python chunk

df_pivot = df_melted.pivot_table(index=["carrier"], values =["delay.time"], columns =["variable"], aggfunc=['mean', 'median'])

print(df_pivot)


```

## Using Python objects in R {#python-R-interface}

Assign the python data frame "flights" created above to an R object. Some things to note: 

* the syntax for this is to put `py$` ahead of the python object name

* this is inside an R chunk

* we will now have identical data frame objects in both our python and R environments



```{r}
# r chunk

flights_SEA <- py$flights_SEA

# display 
head(flights_SEA)
```



### Using a Python data frame in an R {ggplot2} {#python-R-ggplot}



```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(py$flights_SEA, aes(carrier, arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()

```

### Calling R from python

In our examples above, we used python inside RStudio. An interesting recent development is that if you are working strictly in python, you can now call all of your favourite R packages. This means that "Pythonistas can take advantage of the great work already done by the R community."

This article walks though some examples of how Python users can access R packages:

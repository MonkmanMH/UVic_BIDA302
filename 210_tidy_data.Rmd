## Transform Data 3: changing the layout

### Tidy and untidy data

In the dataframes we have used so far, the data is in a format that adheres to the rules of tidy data, where

- each column is a variable
- each row is an observation
- each value has its own cell

>This is called a "long" data format. But, we notice that each column represents a different variable. In the "longest" data format there would only be three columns, one for the id variable, one for the observed variable, and one for the observed value (of that variable). This data format is quite unsightly and difficult to work with, so you will rarely see it in use.

>Alternatively, in a "wide" data format we see modifications to rule 1, where each column no longer represents a single variable. Instead, columns can represent different levels/values of a variable. For instance, in some data you encounter the researchers may have chosen for every survey date to be a different column.

>These may sound like dramatically different data layouts, but there are some tools that make transitions between these layouts much simpler than you might think! The gif below shows how these two formats relate to each other, and gives you an idea of how we can use R to shift from one format to the other.

(From the Data Carpentry lesson [_R for Social Scientists_, "Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr"](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/03-dplyr-tidyr/index.html)—this lesson provides a different example of using {tidyr} to reshape your data.)

The image below shows the relationship between the two versions of the same data:[@AdenBuie_tidyanimated]

![](static/img/original-dfs-tidy.png){width=100%}

The "wide" form doesn't adhere to the rules of tidy data, since each row has multiple observations.


![](static/img/tidyr-pivot_wider_longer.gif){width=100%}

> Untidy data most often look like this:
> * Column headers are values, not variable names.
> * Multiple variables are stored in one column.
> * Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
> * Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
> * A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

### An example

Let's create a pivot table crosstab using the {palmerpenguins} data package of automobile fuel economy.

First, a look at the source table.

```{r}
penguins

```


Use `group_by` and `summarise` to create a summary table of the average bird weight by species. Note that we have to use `na.rm = TRUE` because of the presence of NA values in the variable `body_mass_g`.

```{r}
penguins |>                                
  group_by(species) |>                   
  summarise(mass_mean = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) 

```



Now if we do the same with species and island, we end up with a much longer table. Since we are going to restructure this table, it will be assigned to a new object `penguin_species_by_island`.

```{r}

penguin_species_by_island <- penguins |>                                
  group_by(species, island) |>                   
  summarise(mass_mean = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) 

penguin_species_by_island

```

While this long tabular structure is useful for coding, it's harder for you and I to compare across both the "species" and "island" dimensions. This is a situation where a wide structure is desirable.


### `pivot_wider()`

Let's take the `penguin_species_by_island` table and arrange it so that there is a separate column (variable) for each island. Instead of a single "island" column, there will be multiple columns, one for each island, and with the average weight of the birds of each species on each.

You will note that this is **NOT** a tidy format! But is it one that is human-readable, and is often how data tables are published in reports.


```{r pivot_wider_1}

# pivot table (wide)

penguin_species_by_island_pivot <- penguin_species_by_island |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = island, values_from = mass_mean)

penguin_species_by_island_pivot


```

Note that there are "NA" values introduced into the table. Chinstrap penguins were only recorded on Dream Island, and Gentoo penguins were only on Biscoe Island...NA values appear in the columns where there were no birds of that species row.

### `pivot_longer()`

Now we will pivot the new table back to the original structure. Note that the names of the new variables "island" and "mean_mass" need to be inside quotation marks!

```{r}
# and back to longer...

penguin_species_by_island_unpivot <- penguin_species_by_island_pivot |>
  pivot_longer(-species, names_to = "island", values_to = "mean_mass")

penguin_species_by_island_unpivot

```

What do you notice about the structure of the unpivoted table?

The creation of the wider table introduced "NA" values where there was not an "island" category to match the "species" of penguin. In our new long table, those "NA" values have been retained.



### `spread()` and `gather()` 

Note that `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` are relatively new functions, introduced in 2019.

The older {tidyr} functions that do the same thing: `spread()` and `gather()`. You may find older articles that use these functions...but the new ones are much better!

For example, `spread()` to replicate the `pivot_wider()` function:

```{r}

penguin_species_by_island |>
  spread(key = island, value = mass_mean)

```

## Exercises {#tidy-data-exercise}


::: {.rmdtip}
### Canadian election results



This table shows the national-level results of the Federal Election held in Canada on October 10, 2019. This is structure as the table was published by Elections Canada.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Elections Canada 2019-10-21 Federal Election Results
# https://enr.elections.ca/National.aspx?lang=e
# sourced 2019-11-06
CDN_elec_2019 <- tibble(party = c("Liberal", "Conservative", "Bloc Québécois", "New Democratic", "Green", "Independent"),
                        seats = c(157, 121, 32, 24, 3, 1),
                        votes = c(5915950, 6155662, 1376135, 2849214, 1162361, 75836))
# hahaha! It's easier to make a tidy tibble and untidy it than make a messy one to start with
CDN_elec_2019 <- CDN_elec_2019 |>
  pivot_longer(-party, names_to = "category", values_to = "number")

CDN_elec_2019

```

_1. What tidy data principles does this table violate?_


_2. Tidy this table's structure_

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


**1. What tidy data principles does this table violate?**

It violiates Principles #1 & #2<br>

* There are two variables (seats and votes) combined into one column
* There are two rows (seats and rows) for each observation (in this case, party)

Sometimes untidy data can be too long!


**2. Tidy this table's structure**


To tidy the table, we need to `pivot_wider()`

```{r}
# solution

CDN_elec_2019 |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = number)

```

### gapminder



When we publish our tables, we might want a structure that violates the tidy principles—sometimes an untidy table is better for human consumption. The {gapminder} data, in its raw form, is tidy. For this exercise, create a table that shows:

* GDP per capita for
* the countries Canada, United States, and Mexico are the columns, and 
* the years after 1980 are the rows



<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>




```{r}
# solution #1
gapminder |> 
  filter(country %in% c("Canada", "United States", "Mexico") &
           year > 1980) |>
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = gdpPercap)

# a similar solution that uses "or" for the countries
# and two separate filter statements
gapminder |> 
  filter(country == "Canada" | country == "United States" | country == "Mexico") |> 
  filter(year > 1980) |>
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = gdpPercap)

```

Here's an alternative approach that avoids the use of the `select()` function.

Note that by adding `year` to the `pivot_wider()` all the variables in the final table are explicitly named in the function, and all the other variables in the source table are dropped.

```{r}
gapminder |> 
  filter(country == "Canada" | country == "United States" | country == "Mexico") |> 
  filter(year > 1980) |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year, 
              names_from = "country", 
              values_from = "gdpPercap")

```

In this version, the three variables `continent`, `lifeExp`, and `pop` are dropped with the minus sign—the remaining variables are then reshaped.

```{r}
gapminder |> 
  filter(country %in% c("Canada", "United States", "Mexico")) |> 
  filter(year > 1980) |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(-continent, -lifeExp, -pop), 
              names_from = "country", 
              values_from = "gdpPercap")

```



It's also possible to have multiple columns selected using the `id_cols =` argument:


```{r}
# Three countries from three different continents
gapminder |> 
  filter(country %in% c("Canada", "China", "Croatia")) |> 
  filter(year > 1980) |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(country, continent), 
              names_from = "year", 
              values_from = "gdpPercap")

```

In the examples above, the steps from the source gapminder dataframe to the three country table are completed in a single pipe. But what if we want to create two separate tables with the same three countries, but one with GDP per capita as the values and the second with life expectancy? 

To do this, we create an intermediate object that filters for the year range and the countries we are interested in. 

After that object is created, we can use it to first select for the variables we want, and then to pivot. 

```{r}
# create intermediate dataframe "gapminder1"
gapminder1 <- gapminder |> 
  filter(year > 1980) |> 
  filter(country == "Canada" | country == "Mexico" | country == "Brazil")

# now using the `id_cols = year`, pull the values from gdpPercap 
gapminder1 |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year, 
              names_from = country, 
              values_from = gdpPercap)

# and now a 2nd version with life expectancy, pull the values from lifeExp
gapminder1 |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year, 
              names_from = country, 
              values_from = lifeExp)

```

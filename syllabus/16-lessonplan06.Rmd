# Week 6 (2019-12-07)

_subject to change_


## Objective

At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. Explain the use of statistical models in data analysis,

2. Demonstrate the necessary R script to build a simple model,

3. Explain why iteration is a cornerstone of programming, 

4. Understand the fundamental differences between the R and Python ecosystems, and

5. Write a script in Python to summarize a familiar data table.

6. What-if scenario analysis (WISA)

### 1. Plots, charts and other data visualizations

Format: participation and instructor lecture w/ slides

Time allocation: 15 minutes (9:30 to 9:45)


Format: hands-on exercise

Time allocation: 45 minutes (9:45 to 10:30)


_Reading:_

* _R4DS_, ["Data visualisation"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)

* _R4DS_, ["Exploratory Data Analysis"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html)

* Kieran Healy, [_Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction_](http://socviz.co/) (draft version of the manuscript)

  - If I were teaching a 6-week course on data visualization, this book would be a required text. If you are making charts as part of your work or studies, I _strongly_ encourage you to read through Chapters 1-7! The book is very well laid-out, and includes great advice on good data visualization practice (see [Chapter 1, "Look at data"](http://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata))  
  
  - For this class, we will focus on [8. "Refine your plots"](http://socviz.co/refineplots.html#refineplots)

# Data Analytics Coding Fundamentals

## _Lesson plan, week 1_

**_subject to change_**


## Martin Monkman, instructor


> The important thing is that you solve the problem that you’re working on, not write the most concise and elegant code (although that’s definitely something you want to strive towards!)
> - Grolemund & Wickham, _R for Data Science_



## Objectives

At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. Describe the fundamental elements of good coding practice, and 

2. Demonstrate how these can be applied in a data analytics context.

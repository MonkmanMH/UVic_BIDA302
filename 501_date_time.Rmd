## Introduction: Dates and Times {#date-time-intro}

Working with dates and times is an important "tidy" skill, but it also comes into play for the "Understand" phase.

> To warm up, try these three seemingly simple questions:
> 
> * Does every year have 365 days?
> * Does every day have 24 hours?
> * Does every minute have 60 seconds?

The answer to all of these is "no". (See the introduction to the ["Dates and Times"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html#introduction-10) chapter of _R for Data Science for explanations.)

To add to the challenge, there are different ways to represent a date. Here's some ways that March 28, 2020 might be written:

March 28, 2020
2020-03-28
28 Mar 2020
28-3-20
3/28/2020
Saturday, March 28, 2020

Also, keep in mind that a written-out-month is spelled differently in different languages! For example, April in French is "Avril".



### ISO 8601 and R {#date-time-iso8601}

The ISO 8601 standard is widely recognized as the best way to store dates and times. It removes ambiguity as to which is the day and which is the month (and sometimes the year, if the year is also stored as a two-digit entry). It also sorts in order, with the biggest element (the year) first, followed by the second most important, and so on.


![_XKCD: ISO8601 date-time standard_](static/img/iso_8601.png){width=25%}


### How R stores dates

There are three variable types in tibbles for storing dates:

* date: `<date>`

* time: `<time>`

* date-time: `<dttm>` 


POSIXct is another variable type that will appear in your data!


## {lubridate} functions

While dates and times can be complex, the {lubridate} package gives us some tools to work with them.

See https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html 

First, `now()` can be handy. It's based on your computer settings—so whatever time your machine says, this is what will be returned when you run the following code chunk:

```{r}
now()
```

You can also specify a time zone:

```{r}
now(tz = "UTC")
```




### parsing functions 

One of the most important pieces of working with dates is turning a character or numeric string into a date.

| function | purpose |
| ---- | ---- |
| ymd()  | returns yyyy-mm-dd |
| dmy() | returns yyyy-mm-dd from day-month-year |
| my() | returns yyyy-mm-01 from month-year |
| _etc_ |  |
| ymd_hms() | returns date and time |


### getting, setting, rounding

| function | purpose |
| ---- | ---- |
| today() |  |
| now() |  |
| year(), month(), day() | get components of date|
| _etc_ |  |
| floor_date() | rounds _down_ to nearest boundary of specified time unit |
| ceiling_date() | rounds _up_ to nearest boundary of specified time unit |


## Parsing {#date-time-parsing}

{lubridate} will happily work with numbers and strings, including strings with separators

```{r}

ymd(20200328)

ymd("2020-03-28")

```



Parse "10-11-12" using `dmy()` ... what do you get back?

```{r}
# solution
dmy("10-11-12")

```


What about `mdy()` and `ymd()`?


### Partials

We sometimes see a partial date. For example, a table showing monthly data might have the dates written as "Jan 2020", "Feb 2020", and so on.

{lubridate} parses these by assuming that the date refers to the first day of that month. This then allows us to use the functions below.

```{r}

my("Jan 2020")

```




## Date {#date-time-date}

The three functions `year()`, `month()`, and `day()` allow you to extract that component from a ymd value.

Here are three dates:

```{r}
date1 <- ymd("2019-01-02")
date2 <- ymd("2020-02-29")
date3 <- my("Jan 2020")

```

Here's how we would get the day from `date1`:

```{r}

day(date1)

```



Get the month from `date2`

```{r}
# solution

month(date2)

```

Get the year from `date3`

```{r}

year(date3)

```

::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn


What happens when you add the options `label` and `abbr` to the function you used to get the day?

* experiment with setting the options to TRUE or FALSE


<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


```{r}
# solution
month(date2, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)

```


</details>
:::



::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn



What does `wday()` do? 

* Again, experiment with `label` and `abbr` 

* Bonus: what class of variable is `wday` returning?



<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>



```{r}
# solution

wday(date1)

my_wday <- wday(date1, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
my_wday

class(my_wday)
class(month(date2, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))


```

These variables are ordered factors—the days of the week are arranged in a particular order, and using a factor allows that order to be pre-defined.


</details>
:::



Another useful function is `week()`, which returns the week number. More precisely, 

> `week()` returns the number of complete seven day periods that have occurred between the date and January 1st, plus one.

We often say that "there are 52 weeks in a year", but 365 / 7 = 52.1. This means that the last few days of the year are in the 53rd week.

```{r}

# January 2nd, 2019
week(ymd("2019-01-02"))

# December 30, 2020
week(ymd("2020-12-30"))

```



## Time span {#date-time-span}

There are three classes that we can use:

> * durations, which represent an exact number of seconds.
> * periods, which represent human units like weeks and months.
> * intervals, which represent a starting and ending point.

(from _R for Data Science_)



The ideas of duration and interval are useful in some contexts, where you want to measure a period of time in seconds. For example, you might be measuring how long it takes an individual on a treadmill to get their heart rate up to 120 beats per minute.

For this exercise, we will keep using our three dates and measure the period between them.

We can **subtract** two dates:

```{r}

date2 - date1

```


Here's three different ways of **adding** a year to a date:

```{r}
start_date <- ymd("2019-01-01")

start_date + 365

start_date + dyears(1)

start_date + years(1)
```

::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn

2020 was a leap year... what happens if you use the same three equations that add a year but change the date to "2020-01-01"?


<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


```{r}
# solution
start_date <- ymd("2020-01-01")

start_date + 365

start_date + dyears(1)

start_date + years(1)


```

## Working with dates {#date-time-working}


Read in this extract of a file downloaded from Statistics Canada, which has monthly data showing the British Columbia labour force (both sexes, 15 years and over, unadjusted) from January 2000 to October 2019.

```{r}

lfs_BC_2000 <- read_csv("data/lfs_BC_2000.csv")
lfs_BC_2000
```

The date is shown in the variable `REF_DATE` (short for "reference date"); since it's monthly data, the character representation contains the year and the month, but not the day.

What happens when you mutate `REF_DATE` into a new variable, using the `ymd()` function from {lubridate}?



```{r}
# solution
lfs_BC_2000 %>% 
  mutate(ref_date_2 = ymd(REF_DATE)) %>% 
  select(REF_DATE, ref_date_2) %>% 
  slice(10:15)

```


Oh no! 94 of the 238 failed to parse—the program was unable to convert them due to ambiguity in the numbers. These show up as "NA" values, such as "2000-01". {lubridate} is trying to find a year, a month, and a day in this string, and the "00" value doesn't make sense in this context.

And some of the months that did parse ended up with completely wrong interpretations. The "20" in "2001-01" is interpreted as the year, and the "01"s become the month and day, so it shows up as "2020-01-01".

Back to the drawing board...

Fortunately, {lubridate} has an argument in the `ymd()` function that allows us to deal with this. By adding the `truncated = 2` argument to the function, the strings are interpreted as missing the last characters. The first day of each month is now added to our new variable.


```{r}
# solution
lfs_BC_2000 %>% 
  mutate(ref_date_2 = ymd(REF_DATE, truncated = 2)) %>% 
  select(REF_DATE, ref_date_2)

```


Another approach is to use the `ym()` function, which yields the same result.

```{r}

lfs_BC_2000 <-
  lfs_BC_2000 %>% 
  mutate(ref_date_2 = ym(REF_DATE))

lfs_BC_2000

```





With the reference date now turned into a date format, we can create a line plot, and {ggplot2} will make some decisions for us on the format of the labels on the x-axis.

```{r}

ggplot(lfs_BC_2000, aes(x = ref_date_2, y = VALUE)) +
  geom_line()

```



And now we will create a summary table...the annual average of the number of people in the B.C. labour force.

In this code chunk, the variable "ref_date_2" is inside the `year()` function. This means that the year component of the full date becomes the grouping variable.

```{r}

lfs_BC_2000 %>%
  group_by(year(ref_date_2)) %>% 
  summarise(annual_average = mean(VALUE))

```


Looks like the B.C. labour force is growing!

::: {.rmdtip}
#### Your turn



Is there any seasonality in the size of the labour force? That is, is there a regular and predictable pattern that repeats each year?

<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>


To calculate the **monthly** average over the 20 years in our data, we can use the `month()` function to use the 12 months of the year as our grouping variable.


```{r}

# solution 1
lfs_BC_2000 %>%
  group_by(month(ref_date_2)) %>% 
  summarise(monthly_average = mean(VALUE))
```

In this second solution, the `mutate()` function is used to create a stand-alone variable "ref_month", which becomes the grouping variable.

The `month()` function also includes the argument `label = TRUE`, which adds the abbreviations for the month names.

```{r}

# solution 2
lfs_BC_2000 %>%
  mutate(ref_month = month(ref_date_2, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(ref_month) %>% 
  summarise(monthly_average = mean(VALUE))

```


</details>
:::



Would a simple data visualization (a plot) help you see if there is a pattern?

Of course the answer is "Yes!" Visualization is an important tool in exploratory data analysis. But you knew that already.

(Note that if you haven't already, you will have to create a separate variable with the month value. As of this writing, {ggplot2} doesn't allow you to run a function inside the `aes()`.)

```{r}

lfs_BC_2000 %>%
  mutate(ref_month = month(ref_date_2)) %>% 
  group_by(ref_month) %>% 
  summarise(monthly_average = mean(VALUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ref_month, y = monthly_average)) +
  geom_line()


```


Our plot is a bit off, though, with the x-axis labels showing decimal place months. This is because the "ref_month" variable is a numeric value. 
An effective solution is specify the type of scale in the x-axis, using `scale_x_discrete()`.


```{r}

lfs_BC_2000 %>%
  mutate(ref_month = month(ref_date_2)) %>% 
  group_by(ref_month) %>% 
  summarise(monthly_average = mean(VALUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ref_month, y = monthly_average)) +
  geom_line() +
  # add x-axis scale
  scale_x_discrete(limits = month.abb)

```


Important note: leaving the `labels = TRUE` will not work with this plot! That's because it becomes a factor, which can't be plotted as a line. One solution would be to plot the values using `geom_col()`.




## Date-time {#date-time-date-time}

What is the difference between `today()` and `now()`?

```{r}
# solution

today()

now()

```


`today()` is a date, while `now()` includes the time.


### Time zones

You can specify time zones by adding a time zone option to your call. For example, the time zone in the west coast of North America is often represented as "America/Los_Angeles" or "America/Vancouver".

```{r}

Sys.timezone()

```




What time is it right now? Specify the time zone in the `now()` function with the argument `tzone =` or `tz =`

* at the University of Victoria campus—or maybe Vancouver

* in St. John's, Newfoundland

* in Lima, Peru

* in Seoul, South Korea

* and Universal Time Coordinated (the time zone is represented as "UTC")


```{r}
# Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
now(tzone = "America/Vancouver")

# St. John's, Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada
now(tzone = "America/St_Johns")

# Lima, Peru
now(tzone = "America/Lima")

# Seoul, South Korea
now(tz = "Asia/Seoul")

# Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)
now(tz = "UTC")

```

Some things to notice:

* St. John's is 30 minutes off-set from the other time zones

* Lima doesn't appear with a named "time" unlike the others, but is -05 hours relative to UTC

* For those of us in the western hemisphere, it's almost always tomorrow in Korea!


You can use the function `OlsonNames()` to print a list of all `r length(OlsonNames())` time zones around the world!

```{r}
# solution -- beware the length!
head(OlsonNames())

```


(Note: wrapping a function call with an assignment both runs the assignment _and_ prints the object!)

```{r }
(x1 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 12:00:00", tz = "America/New_York"))

(x2 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 18:00:00", tz = "Europe/Copenhagen"))

(x3 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-02 04:00:00", tz = "Pacific/Auckland"))

```


Subtract date-time from each other

```{r}
#
x2 - x3

```



## Lead and lag {#date-time-lead-lag}

```{r}

df_dates <- tribble(~event, ~event_date,
        "event_1", "2015-01-15",
        "event_2", "2020-02-29",
        "event_3", "2020-04-15"
        )

df_dates <- df_dates %>% 
  mutate(event_date = ymd(event_date))

df_dates

df_summary <- df_dates %>% 
  # create a new variable with the lag from the previous record
  mutate(lag_date = lag(event_date)) %>% 
  # calculate the different between the two dates
  mutate(days_between = event_date - lag_date)

df_summary

```


To calculate the number of years (instead of days), we the need to convert "days_between" from Duration to integer before dividing by 365.25.


```{r}

df_summary %>% 
  mutate(years_between = as.integer(days_between)/365.25)

df_summary %>% 
  summarise(avg_days_between_events = mean(days_between, na.rm = TRUE))

```

### Other units of time


Financial calendars

* [4-4-5 calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%934%E2%80%935_calendar): each quarter is divided into three "months", of 4 or 5 weeks length

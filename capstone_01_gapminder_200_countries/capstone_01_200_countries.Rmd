## Introduction


In this project, you will recreate single year versions of the chart Hans Rosling shows in the video here:

* Gapminder, [200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/200-years-that-changed-the-world-bbc/)




### Data files

I downloaded three files from https://www.gapminder.org/data/ that you will need

There are CSV files for the following:

* Income: "income_per_person_gdppercapita_ppp_inflation_adjusted.csv"

* Life expectancy (years): "life_expectancy_years.csv"

In addition, I downloaded an Excel file that you'll need to use to get the region that each country is in. 

* "Data Geographies - v1 - by Gapminder.xlsx", sheet = "list-of-countries-etc"

# Assignment 3 - exploratory data analysis {#assignment3}


## Introduction

For this homework assignment, please write your answer for each question after the question text but before the line break before the next one.

In some cases, you will have to insert R code chunks, and run them to ensure that you've got the right result.

Use all of the R Markdown formatting you want! Bullets, bold text, etc. is welcome. And don't forget to consider changes to the YAML.

Once you have finished your assignment, create an HTML document by "knitting" the document using either the "Preview" or "Knit" button in the top left of the script window frame


## New Homes Registry

The B.C. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing publishes data from BC Housing's New Homes Registry, by regional district and municipality, by three types types of housing: single detached, multi-unit homes, and purpose built rental.^[Data source: British Columbia Data Catalogue, [New Homes Registry (2016-2020)] (https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/new-homes-registry-2016-2020-). Licensed under Open Government Licence - British Columbia.]

The name of the file is "bc-stats_2018-new-homes-data_tosend.xlsx"


### 1. Explore the file
(marks: 1)

List the sheet names in the file. (You may wish to assign the long and cumbersome name of the source file to a character string object with a shorter, more concise name.)



### 2. Importing a sheet
(marks: 2)

Here's a screenshot of the top rows of the sheet with single detached housing:

![_Excel file: single detached_](static/img/newhomes_single_excel.JPG)

What problems do you anticipate with the way this sheet is laid out? 

* For a data analytics project, will you need all of the rows and columns that have information?

* Check the data types of each column.

Read in the sheet, using no options. What is notable about the content of the R data table, compared to the Excel source?

Read the contents of the file again, so that the header rows are in the right place, and with the "Note:" column omitted.
 
(See [this page on the {readxl} reference material](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/cell-specification.html) for some tips.)
 
Note: there are many possible solutions to this problem. Once you've created an object that you can manipulate in the R environment, your solution may involve some of the {dplyr} data manipulations. 



### 3. Tidy data
(marks: 2)

Does this data frame violate any of the principles of tidy data?
 
If so, use the pivot functions from {tidyr} to turn it into a tidy structure.


### 4. EDA: plotting, 1
(marks: 3)

Now you've got a tidy structure, it's time for some exploratory data analysis!
 
Plot the total number of single detached homes built in B.C. by year.

**Hints and resources:**

* The [Data visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and [Exploratory data analysis](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) chapters of _R for Data Science_ might be handy references

* The [{ggplot2} reference pages](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

* You might need to do further data manipulation before you can plot what you want
 
* Sometimes I find it _very_ helpful to make a sketch of the plot I envision, and then writing down which variables are associated with the bits on the plot



### 5. EDA: plotting, 2
(marks: 3)

Plot the total number of single detached homes built in B.C. by municipality, but only the 10 municipalities with the greatest number of homes built, sorted from most to least. (I will leave it up to you to decide if you want to do that by a single year or by the total of all three years in the data.)
 
**Hints and resources:**
 
* The [Factors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) chapter of _R for Data Science_ 
 
* The [{forcats} reference pages](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)
 
* Again, you might need to do further data manipulation before you can plot what you want

# The Data Science Process

- Wickham and Grolemund, _R4DS_

We have spent 5.5 weeks talking about this process with **R** ... but it's not the only tool set available.

# An analogy...

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car

![VW Beetle frame](../img/VW_ad_1_crop.png)

---

...the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

---

...and RStudio is the dashboard and controls

Python is like an engine.

It can power a car...or a boat, or a water pump, or ...

![VW Beetle engine](../img/1965_Volkswagen-Bug-Which-Came-First-Engine_List-L.jpg)


---

Python is a general=purpose programming language. 

Which means that it _doesn't_ have data analysis functions built in.

When you load base R, in addition to the engine you get the frame, steering wheel, and pedals.

To do data analysis in Python, you need to load the packages that are the frame, steering wheel, etc.

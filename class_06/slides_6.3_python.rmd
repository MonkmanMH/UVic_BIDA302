# The Data Science Process

![the data science process](../img/data-science.png)

- Wickham and Grolemund, _R4DS_

We have spent 5.5 weeks talking about this process with **R** ... but it's not the only tool set available.

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car & basic controls like the pedals and steering wheel

...the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

* the body, windshield, headlights, A/C, sound system, etc

...and RStudio is the dashboard and controls

Python is like an engine.

It can power a car...or a boat, or a water pump, or ...

Python is a general-purpose programming language. 

* Which means that it _doesn't_ have data analysis functions built in.

* When you load base R, you get the engine and the frame, steering wheel, and pedals.

* To do data analysis in Python, you need to load the _modules_ that are the frame, steering wheel, etc.

This exercise uses the SAFI data, and is a modification of content in the [Data Carpentries "R for Social Scientists"](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)

Load the tidyverse and data frame (creates an object named `interviews`):

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE, message=FALSE}

## load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

interviews <- read_csv("data/SAFI_clean.csv", na = "NULL")

## inspect the data
interviews

## preview the data
# View(interviews)
```


## Reshaping with pivot_wider and pivot_longer

In the [spreadsheet
lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheets-socialsci/), we discussed how
to structure our data leading to the four rules defining a tidy dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a table.

In `interviews`, each row contains the values of variables associated with each
record (the unit), values such as the number of household members or possessions
associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we wanted to
look at differences in households grouped by different types of housing
construction materials?

We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised
of values of variables associated with each housing material (e.g. for
`respondent_wall_type`). In practical terms this means the values
of the wall construction materials in `respondent_wall_type` would
become the names of column variables and the cells would contain `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Having created a new table, we can now explore the relationship within and
between household types--for example we could compare the ratio of household
members to sleeping rooms grouped by type of construction material. The key
point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure, but we have
**reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of
a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions, `pivot_wider()`
and `pivot_longer()`.

### Pivoting wider

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the data
2. the *names_from* column variable whose values will become new column names.
3. the *values_from* column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.

Further arguments include `values_fill` which, if set, fills in missing values with
the value provided.

Let's use `pivot_wider()` to transform interviews to create new columns for each type
of wall construction material. We use the pipe as before too. Because both the
`names_from` and `values_from` parameters must come from column values, we will create a
dummy column (we'll name it `wall_type_logical`) to hold the value `TRUE`, which
we will then place into the appropriate column that corresponds to the wall
construction material for that respondent. When using `mutate()` if you give a
single value, it will be used for all observations in the dataset. 

For each row in our newly pivoted table, only one of the newly created wall type columns will be `TRUE`. The default value that `pivot_wider` uses to fill the other wall types is `NA`.

Instead of the default value of `NA`, we want them to be `FALSE`. We will use `values_fill = list(wall_type_logcial = FALSE)` in `pivot_wider()` to fill the rest of the new columns for that row with `FALSE`.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_wide <- interviews %>%
    mutate(wall_type_logical = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = respondent_wall_type, 
                values_from = wall_type_logical, 
                values_fill = list(wall_type_logical = FALSE))
```


View the `interviews_wide` data frame and notice that there is no longer a
column titled `respondent_wall_type`. This is because there is a default
parameter in `pivot_wider()` that drops the original column. The values that were
in that column have now become variables `muddaub`, `burntbricks`, `sunbricks`, and 
`cement`.



### Pivoting longer

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the form
of `interviews_wide`, where the building materials are column names, but we
wish to treat them as values of a `respondent_wall_type` variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them into a pair
of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values, and the
other variable contains the values previously associated with the column names.
We will do this in two steps to make this process a bit clearer.

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the data
2. *cols* are the names of the columns we use to fill the values variable (or to drop).
3. the *names_to* column variable we wish to create from column names.
4. the *values_to* column variable we wish to create and fill with values
associated with the named columns.

To recreate our original data frame, we will use the following:

1. the data - `interviews_wide`
2. the *cols* are the names of the columns that are to be reshaped;
   in this case, they are specified in a list using `c()`.
3. the *names_to* column will be "respondent_wall_type" (as a character string). This
   is the name of the new column we want to create.
4. the *values_to* column will be "wall_type_logical" (as a character string). 
   This will be populated with either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_long <- interviews_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = c(burntbricks, cement, muddaub, sunbricks),
                 names_to = "respondent_wall_type", 
                 values_to = "wall_type_logical")
```


![](fig/pivot_wide_to_long.png)

This creates a data frame with `r nrow(interviews_long)` rows (4 rows per interview respondent). The four rows for each respondent differ only in the value of the "respondent_wall_type" and "wall_type_logical" columns. View the data to see what this looks like.

Only one row for each interview respondent is informative--we know that if the
house walls are made of "sunbrick" they aren't made of any other the other
materials. Therefore, we can filter our dataset to only keep values where
`wall_type_logical` is `TRUE`. Because `wall_type_logical` is already either
`TRUE` or `FALSE`, when passing the column name to `filter()`, it will
automatically already only keep rows where this column has the value `TRUE`. We
can then remove the `wall_type_logical` column. We do all of these steps
together in the next chunk of code:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_long <- interviews_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = c(burntbricks, cement, muddaub, sunbricks),
                 names_to = "respondent_wall_type", 
                 values_to = "wall_type_logical") %>%
    filter(wall_type_logical) %>%
    select(-wall_type_logical)
```

View both `interviews_long` and `interviews_wide` and compare their
structure. 


## Applying `pivot_wider()` to clean our data

Now that we've learned about `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` we're going to put these
functions to use to fix a problem with the way that our data is structured. In
the spreadsheets lesson, we learned that it's best practice to have only a
single piece of information in each cell of your spreadsheet. In this dataset,
we have several columns which contain multiple pieces of information. For
example, the `items_owned` column contains information about whether our
respondents owned a fridge, a television, etc. To make this data easier to
analyze, we will split this column and create a new column for each item. Each
cell in that column will either be `TRUE` or `FALSE` and will indicate whether
that interview respondent owned that item.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned <- interviews %>%
    separate_rows(items_owned, sep=";") %>%
    mutate(items_owned_logical = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned, 
                values_from = items_owned_logical, 
                values_fill = list(items_owned_logical = FALSE))

nrow(interviews_items_owned)
```

There are a couple of new concepts in this code chunk. Let's walk through it
line by line. First we create a new object (`interviews_items_owned`) based on
the `interviews` dataframe.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned <- interviews %>%
```

Then we use the new function `separate_rows()` from the **`tidyr`** package to split the column `items_owned`
based on the presence of semi-colons (`;`). This creates a long format version of the dataset, which has multiple rows for each respondent, each row with a unique item. For example, if a respondent has a television and a solar panel, that respondent will now have two rows, one with "television" and the other with "solar panel" in the `items_owned` column.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
separate_rows(items_owned, sep=";") %>%
```

Lastly, we use `pivot_wider()` to switch from long format to wide format. This
creates a new column for each of the unique values in the `split_items` column,
and fills those columns with `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mutate(items_owned_logical = TRUE) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned,
            values_from = items_owned_logical,
            values_fill = list(items_owned_logical = FALSE))
```

View the `interviews_items_owned` data frame. It should have 
`r nrow(interviews)` rows (the same number of rows you had originally), but extra
columns for each item. 

You may notice that one of the columns in called `\`<NA>\`. This is because the respondents did not own any of the items that was in the interviewer's list. We can use the `rename()` function to change this name to something more meaningful:

```{r}
interviews_items_owned <- interviews_items_owned %>%
    rename(no_listed_items = `NA`)
```

This format of the data allows us to do interesting things, like make a table
showing the number of respondents in each village who owned a particular item:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned %>%
    filter(bicycle) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    count(bicycle)
```

Or calculate the average number of items from the list owned
by respondents in each village:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned %>%
    mutate(number_items = rowSums(select(., bicycle:television))) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    summarize(mean_items = mean(number_items))
```

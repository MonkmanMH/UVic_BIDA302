## 1. Getting started

![reticulate hex](reticulate-735.jpg)

> 
> The reticulate package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. The package includes facilities for:
> 
> Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.
> 
> Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).
> 
> Flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments.
> 
> Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!

(from the [{reticulate} site](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/))


Load reticulate:

```{r libraries}
library(reticulate)

```


The {reticulate} function `py_config()` can be used to see what version of Python is running, and other configuration details

```{r}
py_config()

```


## 2. Python!

It's possible to run Python code chunks inside your R Markdown document. 

In this chunk, we have Python code that 

* first loads the `pandas` module (for data wrangling) and changes the reference to `pd`

* reads the CSV file "flights.csv" (the `flights` table from {nycflights13})

```{python}
# import the `pandas` module so that it's available for use
import pandas as pd

# read the csv file "flights.csv" and assign it to the object "flights"
flights = pd.read_csv("flights.csv")

# print the head (first 5 rows)
print(flights.head())

```

Notice a couple of things:

* the read function adds an index column by default; if you have a table where you have an index variable, you can specify that in the `read_csv`

* that index numbering starts at 0 ... watch for that if you start using row references 


## 3. Filter and select

It's a big table ... over 300,000 rows.


So let's trim it down to a bite size chunk, and create a new Python data frame, `flights_ORD`:

```{python}

# filter so that flights contains just those that are going to ORD
flights_ORD = flights[flights['dest'] == "ORD"]

# select the carrier, departure delay, and arrival delay columns
flights_ORD = flights_ORD[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]

# drop the NAs
flights_ORD = flights_ORD.dropna()

# print the remainer
print(flights_ORD)

```


## 4. Detour: running a Python script inside your RStudio

Run the same code inside an R chunk, by running a Python script ".py" file

```{r}

source_python("py_code.py")

```







## 5. Calculating summary statistics

Mean of departure delay, median of arrival delay.



```{python}

flights_ORD['dep_delay'].mean()


flights_ORD['arr_delay'].median()

```


Another way to go about it would be to select the column as a new object, then calculate.

```{python}

departure_delay = flights_ORD['dep_delay']

departure_delay.mean()

```


### 5a. summary stats table

pandas also has a `describe` function that produces many summary stats:

```{python}

flights_ORD.describe()

```


## 6. Grouping

It's possible to calculate summary statistics by a variable through the `groupby` function.

Here we calculate the mean delays for each airline.

```{python}

flights_ORD.groupby("carrier").mean()

```


The same, but with median.


```{python}

flights_ORD.groupby("carrier").median()

```


## 7. Pivoting

In pandas, the functions to pivot are:

* longer is `melt`

* wider is `pivot_table`


### 7a. melt


```{python}

df_melted = pd.melt(flights_ORD, id_vars=["carrier"], value_vars=["dep_delay", "arr_delay"], value_name="delay.time")

print(df_melted)

```




### 7b. pivot_table

The `pivot_table` function gives another way to calculate grouped statistics. The `index` variable works in the same way as `groupby`.

```{python}

df_pivot = df_melted.pivot_table(index=["carrier"], columns =["variable"], values =["delay.time"])

print(df_pivot)


```


Note that the default statistic here is the mean. We can also specify a different one using the `aggfunc` function:

```{python}

df_pivot = df_melted.pivot_table(index=["carrier"], values =["delay.time"], columns =["variable"], aggfunc='median')

print(df_pivot)


```

Or we can get carried away and have multiple measures:

```{python}

df_pivot = df_melted.pivot_table(index=["carrier"], values =["delay.time"], columns =["variable"], aggfunc=['mean', 'median'])

print(df_pivot)


```

* [3 Examples Using Pivot Table in Pandas](https://cmdlinetips.com/2018/12/pivot-table-in-python-pandas/) (uses the gapminder table as the example)


## 8. Using Python objects in R

Assign the python data frame "flights" to an R object

```{r}

flights_ORD <- py$flights_ORD
flights_ORD
```



### 8a. Using a Python data frame in an R {ggplot2} 



```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(py$flights, aes(carrier, arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Where to from here?

---

## Workflow

* R projects

* naming things

* version control



---

## Data visualization

* more formatting options

* more chart types

* mapping

---

## Modeling

* more advanced regression tools

* machine learning

* text analytics

---

## Functional programming

* turning for-loops into functions

* streamlining your code even more

---

## Data cleaning

>"Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data rather than creating insights" 
>–unknown

* no research to back it up

* Martin's opinion: may be an underestimate

---

## Online resources

* [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)

* [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)

---

## R4DS Online Learning Community

[R4DS learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)

* \#TidyTuesday

* Slack channel - with Office Hours

Slides: [_How can we help?_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jfo_CvTmLf-PtKq2uS5-biklXJRe5hVnhzUjtWTQI3Y/edit#slide=id.gc6f919934_0_0)

## TidyTuesday

* part of the R4DS learning community

[bit.ly/tidyreadme](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) 

* twitter: #TidyTuesday

> Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! 


---


> **Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with something simple!**

–from the TidyTuesday page

## More courses...

### BIDA

* BIDA405 "Data Analytics Provisioning, Importing, Extracting and Manipulation"

  - a deep dive into the "import", "tidy", and "transform" steps (including data cleaning)
  
  - focus on using R for those steps
  
* BIDA404 "Data Visualization and Reporting"

* BIDA406 "Predictive Data Analytics and Modelling"


---

## In-person / virtual community

* R User Groups, including [RLadies](https://rladies.org/about-us/)

* conferences

  - UseR (R Foundation)
  
  - RStudio
  
  - regional conferences (including Cascadia R)
  
  - EARL (London UK and occasional USA)

* BC Government employees: 

  - Data Science Community (R and Python users)

## 1. New Homes Registry

> The B.C. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing publishes data from BC Housing's New Homes Registry, by regional district and municipality, by three types types of housing: single detached, multi-unit homes, and purpose built rental.
>
> The name of this file is "bc-stats_2018-new-homes-data_tosend.xlsx"


### 1a. Explore the file

> List the sheet names in the file. 

```{r}
# create an object with the file name so we can repeat it
data_source <- "bc-stats_2018-new-homes-data_tosend.xlsx"

excel_sheets(data_source)

```


### 1b. Importing a sheet
 
> Here's a screenshot of the top rows of the sheet with single detached housing:
> 
> ![single detached](newhomes_single_excel.JPG)
> 
> What problems do you anticipate with the way this sheet is laid out? 
> 
> * For a data analytics project, will you need all of the rows and columns that have information?
> 
> * Check the data types of each column.
> 
> Read in the sheet, using no options. What is notable about the content of the R data table, compared to the Excel source?


```{r}

read_excel(data_source, sheet = "Single Detached")

```

> Read the file again, so that the header rows are in the right place, and with the "Note:" column omitted.
> 
> (See [this page on the {readxl} reference material](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/cell-specification.html) for some tips.)
> 
> Note: some solutions to this problem would involve some of the {dplyr} data manipulations, once you've created an object that you can manipulate in the R environment.


There are many ways to solve this problem.

Solution 1

```{r}

housing <- read_excel(data_source,
                      sheet = "Single Detached",
                      na = "*",
                      skip = 3)

# Because this has columns F and G included, we can then use "select" to pick the ones we want

housing1 <- housing %>% 
  select(1:4) %>% 
  rename("community" = `...1` )

### ---

# alternate solution
housing %>% 
  select(-(5:6)) %>% 
  rename("community" = `...1` )


# others with names
housing %>% 
  select("community" = `...1`,
         "2016", "2017", "2018")

housing %>% 
  select("community" = `...1`,
         "2016":"2018")

```


Solution, version 2

```{r}

housing2 <- read_excel(data_source, 
                       sheet = "Single Detached", 
                       na = "*",
                       range = cell_limits(c(4, NA), c(NA, 5)))

housing2 %>% 
  select(2:5) %>%
  rename("community" = `...2`)

```


Solution, version 3

```{r}

housing3 <- 
  read_excel("bc-stats_2018-new-homes-data_tosend.xlsx", sheet = "Single Detached",
             na = "*",
             range = anchored("B4", dim = c(NA, 4)))

housing3 <- housing3 %>%
  rename("community" = "...1")

```


Solution, version 4

```{r}
Single_Detached <- read_excel(data_source, sheet = "Single Detached", range = "B5:E164", col_names = c("Community", "2016", "2017", "2018"), col_types = c("guess", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"), na = "*")

Single_Detached
```



### 1c. Tidy data

> Does this data frame violate any of the principles of tidy data?
> 
> If so, use the pivot functions from {tidyr} to turn it into a tidy structure.

```{r}

housing1

housing1_long <- housing1 %>%
  pivot_longer(-community, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "units")

housing1_long

# another solution: drop NA values in pivot (rather than later)
housing1 %>%
  pivot_longer(-community, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "units", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE)
```


```{r}

# here's the behaviour of `drop_na()`
# first we make a simple table with 2 variables and 4 rows
testtable <- tribble(~var1, ~var2,
        1, 1,
        2, NA,
        NA, 3,
        NA, NA)
testtable

testtable %>% 
  drop_na()



```

### 1d. EDA: plotting, 1

> Now you've got a tidy structure, it's time for some exploratory data analysis!
> 
> Plot the total number of single detached homes built in B.C. by year.
> 
> **Hints and resources:**
> 
> * The [Data visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and [Exploratory data analysis](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) chapters of _R for Data Science_ might be handy references
> 
> * The [{ggplot2} reference pages](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
> 
> * You might need to do further data manipulation before you can plot what you want
> 
> * Sometimes I find it _very_ helpful to make a sketch of the plot I envision, and then writing down which variables are associated with the bits on the plot

```{r}
housing1_long %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(units = sum(units, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = units)) +
         geom_col()
```



### 1e. EDA: plotting, 2

> Plot the total number of single detached homes built in B.C. by municipality, but only the 10 municipalities with the greatest number of homes built, sorted from most to least. (I will leave it up to you to decide if you want to do that by a single year or by the total of all three years in the data.)
> 
> **Hints and resources:**
> 
> * The [Factors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) chapter of _R for Data Science_ 
> 
> * The [{forcats} reference pages](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)
> 
> * Again, you might need to do further data manipulation before you can plot what you want



```{r}

housing2_long <- housing1_long %>%
  group_by(community) %>%
  summarise(units = sum(units, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  # sort the table by the number of units
  arrange(desc(units)) %>%
  # take the top 10 rows of the table
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  # set "community" as a factor variable so that the order of the summary table becomes the order for the plot
  mutate(community = as_factor(community)) 

# check the factor order
levels(housing2_long$community)

# plot
ggplot(housing2_long, aes(x = community, y = units)) +
         geom_point()

```

An alternative solution that 

* puts the data manipulation _inside_ the `ggplot()` call

* uses the `reorder()` function

* uses a `geom_col()`

```{r}

ggplot(housing1_long %>% 
  group_by(community) %>% 
  tally(units, sort = TRUE, name = "3 Year Total") %>% 
  slice(1:10), aes(x = reorder(community, - `3 Year Total`), y = `3 Year Total`))+
  geom_col()

```


Another slicing solution using `slice_max()`

* specify the variable to be evaluated for the maximum values (`3 Year Total`) and how many (10)

* there's also a `slice_min()`

* see https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html

```{r}

data_source_long %>% 
  filter(years == "2018") %>% 
  rename("municipality" = `...1`) %>% 
  slice_max(`3 Year Total`, n = 10)


```

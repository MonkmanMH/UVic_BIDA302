# Why code?


## Reproducible workflow

>Saves time,
>Produces better science,
>Creates more trusted research,
>Reduces the risk of errors, and
>Encourages collaboration.

Base R

* a data science / statistics programming language

* built-in analytic functions

# packages

Packages extend the functionality of R

* statistical and data analysis

* data visualization

* data

# {tidyverse}

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

# An analogy...

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car

..the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

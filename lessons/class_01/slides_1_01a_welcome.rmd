## Meta outcome 1: using **R**

Programming environment designed for statistical analysis / data science 

* Focus on one tool, so you get good at that


---
class: inverse


## Meta outcome 2: principles 

Concepts and practices that you can carry through to data analysis in other environments

* later in the course we will have examples of coding in Excel and Python

### Weekly assignments (marks: 12 each, 48 total)

* Four assignments, due Weeks 2 through 5.

* These four assignments will review the concepts introduced in that week's lesson and build on previous concepts.

* The assignments will be introduced and discussed at the end of the week's lesson; there may be time to work on the assignment in-class.

* There will be no "weekly assignment" introduced in week 5 and to hand in at Week 6, because you'll be working on your Capstone Project that week.

* **Due date:** Each assignment is due at 23:59 (11:59 pm) on the Thursday following the class; late assignments will be accepted until 8:00 am Saturday following class. Anything later than that will not be accepted, as we will review the assignment during Saturday's class.

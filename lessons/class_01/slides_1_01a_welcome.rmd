# An analogy...

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car

![VW Beetle frame](../../static/img/VW_ad_1_crop.png)

---

..the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

# ...but computers are literal

# Naming objects in R

Object names: 

* must start with a letter

* can only contain letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

Be descriptive!

---


## Three principles for (file) names

machine readable

human readable

plays well with default ordering

* from Jenny Bryan, ["How to name files"](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)

---

### Naming files

Some other suggestions: 

* only use letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

# Dates

## ISO 8601

YYYY-MM-DD

Note: see XKCD, ["ISO 8601"](https://xkcd.com/1179/)

## RStudio

![RStudio panes](../../static/img/RStudio_panes.png)



---

## Console

## R as calculator

Type in the console window:

`10 + 4`

--

What happened?


---

First create a new R script file


---

# The power of named variables 

## the assignment arrow

`<-`

> "less than" plus hyphen


---

## assign the object "x" with the value 10

`x <- 10` 

--

> To show `x` in the console, just type `x`


---

> How would you create a new object "y" with the value 4?

--


`y <- 4`


> Now add x and y

--


`x + y`

--

> Did you notice the change in the Environment pane?


---

# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

--

`x <- 20`

--

# And now divide `x` by `y`

`x / y`

---

`t <- "If it's inside quotation marks, it's a character"`


Now print the object `t`


---

# Quick Detour
## functions for objects

|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| `ls()`    | *list objects*|
| `str()`    | *display structure of object*|
| `ls.str()`    | *list objects and their structure*|
| `names()`    | *display structure of object*|



---

## Vector -- a series of values

`x <- 1:10`

`x <- seq(1, 10)`

---

# `c` to make a list

`c` is for "concatenate"

x <- c(1, 5, 6)

y <- c("British Columbia", "Alberta")

---

# The difference between vectors and lists

A vector can contain only one type of variable (all numbers, or all characters)

* 1, 2, 3

* "BC", "AB", "SK"

A list can contain any type of variable

* 1, "BC", NA


---

# Functions

general structure:

`function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)`

--

a simple example:

`mean(x)`

Two tidyerse data transformation packages we will be using today:

{dplyr} - data wrangling

{tidyr} - to pivot (spread and gather) data tables


---

## Loading a package

There are two steps to getting a package ready to use:

1. download and install

`install.packages()`

**Our RStudio environment has all the packages you'll need!**

2. load

`library()`

# Quick Detour
##getting help

In the console, typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing


---

# Quick Detour
## other sources of help

* `?package` or `?function`

* package page and vignettes

* cheat sheets

* Stack Overflow

* blogs

## What data scientists do


> Data scientists spend 60% of their time on cleaning and organizing data. Collecting data sets comes second at 19% of their time, meaning data scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data for analysis.

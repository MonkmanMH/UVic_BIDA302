# Naming objects in R

Object names: 

* must start with a letter

* can only contain letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

Be descriptive!

## Three principles for (file) names

machine readable

human readable

plays well with default ordering

* from Jenny Bryan, ["How to name files"](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)

### Naming files

Some other suggestions: 

* only use letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

## Loading a package

There are two steps to getting a package ready to use:

1. download and install

`install.packages()`

Our RStudio environment has all the packages you'll need!

2. load

`library()`

##getting help

In the console, typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing

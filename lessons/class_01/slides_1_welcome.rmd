# Learning outcomes

* Perform basic data manipulations
* Create variables
* Apply key concepts of variables, constants and functions
* Calculate descriptive statistics
* Perform basic logical formula functions
* Group and ungroup data
* Data importing & exporting
* Extract and combine data
* Create _what-if_ scenarios



---


## Meta outcome 1: using R

Programming environment designed for statistical analysis / data science 

* Focus on one tool, so you get good at that


---


## Meta outcome 2: principles 

Concepts and practices that you can carry through to data analysis in other environments

* examples of coding to achieve the same result in Excel and Python

# The course moodle

link: [continuingstudies.uvic.ca/](https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/), then login with NetLink 

* course outline

* lesson plans and slide decks

* links to other reading material and data files

* forum

# RStudio Cloud

Web-based version of R & RStudio

[Link](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/34702/join?access_code=lr5keQ5WXcZ5ENNAZoLEAmPSQHav8seVNT2j36e%2F) (but will be invitation-only after today's class)

* later in the course we'll run through the steps to install R on your own computer 

  - this is not necessary for this class!
  
  - but it's a useful thing to know

# Why code?

If we can do this work with other tools, why should we learn to undertake data analytics in a coding environment?

## Reproducible workflow

>Saves time,

>Produces better science,

>Creates more trusted research,

>Reduces the risk of errors, and

>Encourages collaboration.

# 1. Base R

* a data science / statistics programming language

* built-in analytic and statistical functions



---

# 2. packages

Packages extend the functionality of R

* data analysis and statistical modeling

* data wrangling & cleaning

* data visualization

* data

# 3. RStudio

IDE (interactive development environment)

* we will be using the cloud (internet) version of the IDE

* "RStudio" is also the company that developed and supports the IDE

* RStudio is also active creating and supporting packages, including...

# An analogy...

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car

![VW Beetle frame](../../static/img/VW_ad_1_crop.png)

..the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

...and RStudio is the dashboard and controls

# ...but computers are literal

Accuracy matters

And spelling matters

* Group and ungroup data
* Data importing & exporting
* Extract and combine data
* Create _what-if_ scenarios

## Meta outcome 1: using **R**

Programming environment designed for statistical analysis / data science 

* Focus on one tool, so you get good at that


---
class: inverse


## Meta outcome 2: principles 

Concepts and practices that you can carry through to data analysis in other environments

* later in the course we will have examples of coding in Excel and Python

### Weekly assignments (marks: 12 each, 48 total)

* Four assignments, due Weeks 2 through 5.

* These four assignments will review the concepts introduced in that week's lesson and build on previous concepts.

* The assignments will be introduced and discussed at the end of the week's lesson; there may be time to work on the assignment in-class.

* There will be no "weekly assignment" introduced in week 5 and to hand in at Week 6, because you'll be working on your Capstone Project that week.

* **Due date:** Each assignment is due at 23:59 (11:59 pm) on the Thursday following the class; late assignments will be accepted until 8:00 am Saturday following class. Anything later than that will not be accepted, as we will review the assignment during Saturday's class.

## Reproducible workflow

>Saves time,
>Produces better science,
>Creates more trusted research,
>Reduces the risk of errors, and
>Encourages collaboration.

# About R


---

![R logo](/static/img/R.jpg)

## R

* a data science / statistics programming language

* built-in analytic functions

* "base R"


---

## packages

Packages extend the functionality of R

* statistical and data analysis

* data visualization

* data


---

![RStudio logo](/static/img/RStudio_400.png)


---


# RStudio

IDE (interactive development environment)

* also the company that developed and supports the IDE

* RStudio is also active creating and supporting packages, including...

# The Tidyverse

# {tidyverse}

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

# An analogy...

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car

![VW Beetle frame](/static/img/VW_ad_1_crop.png)

---

..the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

![VW Beetle transparent](/static/img/vwlooking.jpg)



---

...and RStudio is the dashboard and controls

![VW Beetle dashboard](/static/img/VW_dashboard.jpg)

...although it's much more modern

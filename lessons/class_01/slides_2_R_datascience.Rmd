---

First create a new R script file


---

## Console

R as a calculator:

Type in the console window:

`10 + 4`

--

What happened?


---

# R script file

First create a new R script file

* an R script file allows you to save your R code

---

# The power of named variables 

## the assignment arrow

`<-`

> "less than" plus hyphen

--

Read it as:

`object <- value`

`new_thing <- old_thing`

---

## assign the object "x" with the value 10

`x <- 10` 

--

> To show `x` in the console, just type `x`


---

> How would you create a new object "y" with the value 4?

--


`y <- 4`


> Now add x and y

--


`x + y`

--

> Did you notice the change in the Environment pane?


---

# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

--

One solution:

`x <- 20`

-- 

Another solution: since we earlier assigned `x` a value of 10

`x <- x * 2`


---

# And now divide `x` by `y`

`x / y`

---

`t <- "If it's inside quotation marks, it's a character"`


Now print the object `t`



---

# Quick Detour
## functions for objects

|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| `ls()`    | *list objects*|
| `str()`    | *display structure of object*|
| `ls.str()`    | *list objects and their structure*|
| `names()`    | *display structure of object*|



---

## Vector -- a series of values

`x <- 1:10`

`x <- seq(1, 10)`

---

# `c` to make a list

`c` is for "combine"

`x <- c(1, 5, 6)`

`y <- c("British Columbia", "Alberta")`



---

# Functions

general structure:

`function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)`

--

a simple example:

`mean(x)`

### R Markdown

.pull-left[
...allows you to 

* save and execute code 

* generate high quality reports

* use as a working notebook
]

--

.pull-right[
...and output:

* HTML (for web browsers)

* Word, PDF

* slides (including PowerPoint)

]

Used for reports and academic articles, books, blogs and websites

# Markdown

A simplified formatting markup language with plain text syntax


Combines text (in Markdown) with R code

* the cheat sheet!

Work within RStudio...

# {tidyverse} -

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

The [{tidyverse} site](https://tidyverse.org): tidyverse.org

---

Two tidyerse data transformation packages we will be using today:

{dplyr} - data wrangling

{tidyr} - to pivot (spread and gather) data tables


---

## Loading a package

There are two steps to getting a package ready to use:

1. download and install

`install.packages()`

**In our RStudio environment you do not need to do this!!!**

It is set up with all the packages you'll need!

2. load

`library()`

# Quick Detour
##getting help

In the console, typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing


---

# Quick Detour
## other sources of help

* `?package` or `?function`

* package page and vignettes

* cheat sheets

# What data scientists do


> Data scientists spend 60% of their time on cleaning and organizing data. Collecting data sets comes second at 19% of their time, meaning data scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data for analysis.

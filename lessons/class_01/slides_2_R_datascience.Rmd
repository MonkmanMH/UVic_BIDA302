## Console

R as a calculator:

Type in the console window:

`10 + 4`

First create a new R script file

# The power of named variables 

## the assignment arrow

`<-`

> "less than" plus hyphen

--

Read it as:

`object <- value`

`new_thing <- old_thing`

---

## assign the object "x" with the value 10

`x <- 10` 

--

> To show `x` in the console, just type `x`


---

> How would you create a new object "y" with the value 4?

--


`y <- 4`


> Now add x and y

--


`x + y`

--

> Did you notice the change in the Environment pane?


---

# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

--

One solution:

`x <- 20`

-- 

Another solution: since we earlier assigned `x` a value of 10

`x <- x * 2`


---

# And now divide `x` by `y`

`x / y`

---

`t <- "If it's inside quotation marks, it's a character"`


Now print the object `t`

## Loading a package

There are two steps to getting a package ready to use:

1. download and install

`install.packages()`

**In our RStudio environment you do not need to do this!!!**

It is set up with all the packages you'll need!

2. load

`library()`

# Quick Detour
##getting help

In the console, typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing

class: inverse

# Quick Detour
## other sources of help

* `?package` or `?function`

* package page and vignettes

* cheat sheets

# What data scientists do


> Data scientists spend 60% of their time on cleaning and organizing data. Collecting data sets comes second at 19% of their time, meaning data scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data for analysis.

# Naming things

## Naming objects in R

Object names: 

* must start with a letter

* can only contain letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

Be descriptive!

## Three principles for (file) names

machine readable

human readable

plays well with default ordering

* from Jenny Bryan, ["How to name files"](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)

### Naming files

Some other suggestions: 

* only use letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

## Dates

### ISO 8601

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)
#
library(stringr)  # {stringr} is part of the tidyverse, but not a core package that loads with {tidyverse}

```



## Objectives

* Understand the basics of regular expressions (regexps)

* Understand basic functions in {stringr} for working with strings

* Demonstrate ability to use those functions


## Strings

Characters, numbers, etc

```{r}

string1 <- "This is my 1st string!"

string1

```

## 1. Regular expressions

See https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html

Also, as a handy tool: https://regex101.com/


### matching functions

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "abc" | matches "abc" |
| "[a][b][c]" | matches "abc" |
| "[abc]" | matches "a", "b", or "c" |
| "[^abc]" | matches anything _except_ "a", "b", or "c" |
| "^" | match start of string |
| "$" | match end of string |


```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")

# which words start with "a"?
str_view(x, "^a")

# which words have an "ea" combination?

str_view(x, "ea")

```

### Your turn 1.1 

Which words end with "a"?

```{r your_turn_1.1}


```


frequency of match

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "?" | 0 or 1 |
| "+" | 1 or more |
| "*" | 0 or more |


The question mark is useful for words with various spellings -- the British and American variations of words like "colour" and "neighbour".

| character | what it does |
| ---- | ---- |
| "{n}" | exactly n times |
| "{n,}" | n or more |
| "{n,m}" | between n and m times |

```{r}
# which words have a double "p"?

str_view(x, "p{2}")


```



## 2. Special characters

**quotes**

Single and double quotes need to be "escaped" with a `\`

```{r}

double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"

double_quote
single_quote

```


* to see a representation of the string as it will print, use the function `writeLines()`

```{r}

writeLines(double_quote)

```



```{r}

string2 <- 'The 2nd string has a "quote" so it is inside single quotes'

string2

writeLines(string2)

```


**other special characters**

These also need to be escaped:

| character | what it is |
| ---- | ---- |
| "\\" | backslash |
| "\d" | any digit |
| "\n" | newline (line break) |
| "\s" | any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
| "\t" | tab |
| "\u..." | unicode characters* |


* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters

See the help function for `?'"'`

```{r}
interrobang <- "\u2048"
interrobang

```


To make a shruggie, you need to escape the backslash

```{r}

shruggie <- glue::glue("¯\\_(ツ)_/¯")
shruggie

shruggie <- glue::glue("¯\\", "_(ツ)_", "/¯")
shruggie

```





## 3. Basic functions in {stringr}.
 

![stringr hex](..\img\stringr_300.png)


```{r string_length}

x <- c("Sly", "Billie", "Thelonious", "Maroon", "Willie", "Led")
x
str_length(x) 

```


use `str_c` to collapse list into one string

```{r str_c}

str_c(x, collapse = ", ")

```


---

## 4. Combining strings

Use `str_c` to join two character vectors, separated by a space


```{r str_c_2}


y <- c("Stone", "Ellish", "Monk", "5", "Nelson", "Zeppelin")

str_c(x, y, sep = " ")

```

## Your turn 4.1

Now join `x` to `y` (the other way around!), separated by an apostrophe and a space

```{r your_turn_4.1}



```

---

## 5. Pattern matching

## Your turn 5.1

Are there any vowels in the string `x`? Use `str_detect()`

And count them with `str_count()`:

```{r str_count}

```

Are there any digits in `y`? (Don't forget that you need to escape any backslashes you use!)

```{r}

```




Extract chunks of text by their location: `str_sub(x, start, end)`


```{r str_sub}
# solution
str_sub(x, 1, 2)  


```


`str_locate()` finds the first position of the pattern:

```{r}

# look for pairs of vowels
str_locate(x, "[aeiou][aeiou]")

# look for a specific match ...
str_locate(x, "oo")

```


Extract the first case of a vowel:

```{r}

str_extract(x, "[aeiou]")

```

## Your turn 5.2

Extract the pairs of vowels:

```{r your_turn_5.2}


```



---

## 6. Splitting strings

https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_split.html

function: `str_split()`


Back to the various ways dates are represented: if it's a character string with the month and year.

"Jan 2019"

```{r}

our_date <- "Jan 2019"


lubridate::ymd(our_date)


```

So that doesn't work.

We can split the string into two parts using `str_split()`, where we specify the space as the splitting element:

```{r}

str_split(our_date, " ")

```

Here we have four month-years, arranged alphabetically:

```{r}

four_dates <- tribble(~ref_date, "Dec 2019", "Feb 2020", "Jan 2018", "Mar 2021")

four_dates <- four_dates %>% 
  mutate(value = 1:4)

four_dates

```

Inside a tibble, we use `separate()` from the {tidyr} package:

* https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html

```{r}

four_dates2 <- four_dates %>% 
  separate(ref_date, into = c("ref_mon", "ref_year"), sep = " ")

four_dates2

```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6549239/convert-months-mmm-to-numeric


Back to factors!

```{r}

# create a list that will be the month levels:

month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)


four_dates3 <- four_dates2 %>% 
  mutate(ref_mon2 = factor(ref_mon, levels = month_levels)) %>%
  arrange(ref_mon2)

four_dates3

```


```{r}

four_dates_list <- four_dates3 %>% 
  glue::glue_data("{ref_year}-{ref_mon2}-01")

four_dates_list

```


Now it's in a format that {lubridate} can understand, and convert to a <date> class:

```{r}


ymd(four_dates_list)

```


And here's three different ways to add our new list back onto the data table:

```{r}
# in a pipe:
four_dates3 %>% 
  mutate(ref_date_x = ymd(four_dates_list))

# for fans of the <table>$<variable> structure:
four_dates3$ref_date_y <- ymd(four_dates_list)

# and a new function, `cbind()`:
cbind(four_dates3, ymd(four_dates_list))

```


For more on `cbind()` (for column bind) and its parallel `rbind()` (for row bind), see:

## Utilities in R


## {glue} 

* [{glue}](https://glue.tidyverse.org/)

* You can use a function that you have installed but not loaded through the `library()` function, by putting the name of the package followed by the function you want to use. In this case, we are using the `glue()` function from the {glue} package, so our code looks like `glue::glue()`. The variable from our data frame gets put in braces, and the string returned is all within quotation marks.





## {janitor} 

* [{janitor}](http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/)

## {datapasta}

This is the preliminary step to recreate the chart Hans Rosling shows in the video here:

* Presentation Zen, [Hans Rosling: the zen master of presenting data](https://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2010/07/hans-rosling-tips-on-presenting-data.html), 2010-07-11

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

At the end of this section, you will have plotted some gapminder data to produce an approximation of this chart:

![Hans Rosling, aging Europe 1961](../img/Hans_Rosling_aging_europe.JPG)

Or, more precisely:
Because the population aged 60+ data is published for every fifth year, there will be two charts: one for 1960, the other for 2015.

```{r}

```

I downloaded the data tables from https://www.gapminder.org/data/, for 

* Population, total

* Population, aged 60+

* Babies per woman (total fertility)


### Load and select

```{r}

pop_total <- read_csv("population_total.csv")

pop_60plus <- read_csv("population_aged_60plus_years_total_number.csv")

children_per_woman <- read_csv("children_per_woman_total_fertility.csv")

```


```{r}

pop_total

```


```{r}

pop_total %>%
  select(country, "1960", "2015")

```



```{r}

pop_60plus %>%
  select(country, "1960", "2015")

```

```{r}

children_per_woman %>%
  select(country, "1960", "2015")


```

# Project (Course Outline)

Project (marks: 40)

* a small project that will require the application of all of the concepts introduced

–importing data–data wrangling

–data modeling and summarization

–communication


# Project objective 

The idea of the capstone project is that you will create an R Markdown document that follows the steps in the "data science process" as shown in _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund:

![data science process](../img/data-science.png)

To do this, you will start at the end: a summary table and/or a plot of some data that has been published. The goal is to replicate that summary table and plot, starting with downloading the data ("import"), and doing any necessary data tidying, transformations, and modeling, followed by tabular or plotting visualizations.

# Grading

Your project will be graded based on the following scheme:

* 5 marks - data import, including defining the variable types

* 15 marks - tidying and manipulation

* 5 marks - visualization (tables and plots)

* 5 marks - going beyond: this might included adding an additional table, plot, or statistical model, or using functions so that your code isn't as WET

* 10 marks - documentation throughout, explaining what the following R code chunk is doing.

# Capstone project description 

The capstone project assignment is to create an R Markdown document that follows the steps in the "data science process" as shown in _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund:

![data science process](../img/data-science.png)

---

To do this, you will have the end already defined: a summary table and/or a plot of some data that has been published. 

The assignment is to replicate that summary table and plot

* starting with downloading the data ("import")
* doing any necessary data tidying, transformations, and modeling, 
* followed by tabular or plotting visualizations



---

# Evaluation

The capstone project has a total of 40 marks <br>(it therefore represents 40% of your grade)

Your project will be evaluated based on the following marking scheme:

| MARKS | OUTCOME |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | data import, including defining the variable types |
| 15 | tidying and manipulation |
| 5 | visualization -- tables and plots |
| 5 | going beyond -- this might included adding an additional table, plot, or statistical model, or using functions so that your code isn't as WET |
| 10 | documentation throughout, explaining what the following R code chunk is doing

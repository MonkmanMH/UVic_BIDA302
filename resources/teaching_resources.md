## Course preparation

I’ve attached  a draft course outline template, which you are free to change up. There are some great resources on creating course outlines on the Learning Teaching Support and Innovation Center (LTSI) website – as an example, here is a link to a course outline/syllabus checklist of information to think about https://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/assets/docs/instructors/for-review/Teaching%20Preparation%20Pre-semester/SyllabusChecklist_May_2011.pdf.

 

I’ve also attached the descriptions and outcomes for not only your course, but all courses we will be (eventually) offering, so that you may see where the other courses will ‘begin’ in order to prepare students. Olga Gould will be instructing BIDA 301 Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Fundamentals preceding yours – many students registered in her class have also registered in yours (a number will only be completing her course, and a number will only be completing your course). She is just finalizing her course outline now and I can send to you after she completes. Additionally, if you are interested in connecting with her as you prepare I am certain she would be amenable.

 

## Participants

Participants in the course are not expected to have any coding experience. Registrants thus far seem to be a mix of early to mid-career professionals looking to upgrade their skills, along with others looking to enter the data analytics field. Additionally, we also have a few registrants from out Business Diploma program (as this course is an acceptable elective course option). Registrants will vary in age, but all will be adult learners – some returning to study for the first time in a long time.

 

It will be important to remember some principles of teaching to adult leaners – adult learners want to ensure learning is useful and relevant to them (especially important to focus on relevant assignments), they will bring previous experiences into the classroom, and are in class because they want to be. Please see these resources to better understand adult learners motivations and learning goals:

## Assignments

As you prepare for assignments in the course, I’ll pass along these resources. There is information on the Learning Teaching Support Innovation (LTSI) website including these information tip sheets on effective assignment design and feedback https://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/assets/docs/instructors/for-review/Teaching%20Preparation%20Pre-semester/AssignmentDesignandEffectiveFeedbackAug2009.pdf and https://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/assets/docs/instructors/for-review/Teaching%20Support/b---information-about-grading-for-instructors-january-2019.pdf

Additionally, some general tips on creating assignments for adult leaners include a preference for scaffolder assignments – one assignment building on another; a preference for hands-on and assignments; a preference for assignments that are applicable to their real-life. When thinking of assignments, you will want to consider how the participants will demonstrate an understanding of the subject - how do you know they learned, how do they know they learned.

 

## Software

Excel, Python, and R are expressly noted in the course outcomes and description. Through consultations with our advisory committee, previous registrants of the pilot program, faculty in computer science, and partners in the tech community, it was stressed that excel, python, and r were the most important languages to understand – often the program used would be determined by field or place of employment. My preference would be that if you are focussing on one program, to provide alternative for those using the others (here is how you do it in python, if you are only using excel, here s what you can do). Do you think this can work for you Martin?

 

## Moodle

You will have use of a course  moodle site for supplementary resources, additional activities, etc.  – there are no expectations that students must be using the Moodle site, but it is a great resource for additional resources for those coming in with no knowledge whatsoever, and potentially additional resources for those with more advanced skillsets as well. The previous unsuccessful pilot program was delivered mainly online – while I do not want you to emulate or use most of the materials from that pilot, I will copy out some case studies, etc. that may be of interest for you to use on the supplementary site if you desire. I am just cleaning this up now and will send ASAP.

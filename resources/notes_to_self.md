### Other online courses

I don't have any experience with these, and don't endorse them in any way. 

But with that said, I have known people who have taken some of these courses, and speak highly of them:

* Coursera: the Data Science specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera seems to offer something quite similar to what we covered in BIDA 302. I am familiar with some of the work of one of the instructors, Dr. Roger Peng, and think he'd probably be a good teacher. They have delivered thousands of these courses, and get very high ratings (~4.5 on a 5 point scale)    https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science

* Coursera also has other data science specializations and stand-alone courses, including ["Executive Data Science"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/executive-data-science) and ["R programming"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)

* For a pretty intense deep dive into maching learning, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) has been getting rave reviews from the people I know who have taken it. It might be a step beyond BIDA 406...so keep it in mind for when you have completed that!

This note would not be complete with mention of DataCamp. This organization solicited lessons from some really great instructors, but the corporate culture, uhm, leaves something to be desired, so I cannot endorse it. [This article by Daniel McNichol gives a detailed history.](https://dnlmc.medium.com/dont-use-datacamp-ef04adcf1b7f#)

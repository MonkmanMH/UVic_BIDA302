## Examining the data

When we import a dataframe into a spreadsheet or other data analysis tool, we immediately _see_ the data. In Excel, the Gapminder dataset looks like this:

Like the crew of the Enterprise, we get the data "On screen!" so we can visually investigate it.

#### _Looking_ at data

In R, when we load a dataframe:

* we assign it to an object

* and that object shows up in our Environment pane.

This is a different view of the universe.



In R, there are a few options for visually scanning your data:


| function | description |  
|||  
|*Content: * | |
|`head()` | shows the first rows; the default is 6 |
|`tail()` | shows the last rows; the default is 6 | 
|`view()` or `View()`| display in tab |


***


In addition to visually inspecting the data, there are also other functions to understand a dataframe:

| function | description |  
|||  
|*Size:*  | |
|`dim()` | returns a vector with the number of rows as the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the dimensions of the object) |
|`nrow()` | returns the number of rows |
|`ncol()` | returns the number of columns |


Functions to understand the contents of your dataframe:

| function | description |  
|||  
|*Names:* | |
|`names()` | returns the column names (synonym of colnames() for data.frame objects) |
|*Summary:* | |
|`ls()` | returns the names in a specified environment or object  |
|`str()` | structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column |
| `ls.str()` | combines `ls()` and `str()`| 
|`summary()` | summary statistics for each column |
|`glimpse()` | returns the number of columns and rows of the tibble, the names and class of each column, and previews as many values will fit on the screen. Unlike the other inspecting functions listed above, glimpse() is not a “base R” function so you need to have the dplyr or tibble packages loaded to be able to execute it. |

Note: most of these functions are “generic.” They can be used on other types of objects besides dataframes or tibbles.  



## Variable types 

In R (as with other programming languages), data is stored as different variable types. In a spreadsheet program like Excel this is obscured from the user, but in R it's explicit, and in many contexts, it matters.

`int` stands for integers.

`dbl` stands for doubles, or real numbers.

`chr` stands for character vectors, or strings.

`date` stands for dates.

`dttm` stands for date-times (a date + a time).

`fctr` stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables with fixed possible values.


`lgl` stands for logical, vectors that contain only TRUE or FALSE.


### Missing values `NA` 

`NA` are explicitly missing values.

* they can be included as any type: e.g. numeric or character


> See [_R for Data Science_, "Data transformation: Missing values](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#missing-values)


Missing values are _contagious_

* an `NA` in the input will return an `NA` in the output

Three simple examples:

```{r}
1 + NA
```

```{r}
num_list <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
1 + num_list
```

```{r}
mean(num_list)
```



Or a longer example...

This data has multiple NAs in the "displ_mean" column.

`displ_class_by_cyl`

```{r echo=FALSE}
# summary table - class by cylinder
displ_class_by_cyl <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class, cyl) %>%
  summarise(displ_mean = mean(displ)) %>%
  arrange(desc(displ_mean)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = cyl, values_from = displ_mean) %>%
  pivot_longer(-class, names_to = "cyl", values_to = "displ_mean")

displ_class_by_cyl

```


What happens when we calculate the mean of "displ_mean"?

```{r}
mean(displ_class_by_cyl$displ_mean)
```


The solution:

`na.rm` removes `NA`s from the calculation

```{r}
mean(displ_class_by_cyl$displ_mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```



#### Functions for missing values

Dealing with those pesky `NA` values  

| function | action |
| : --  | : |
| `is.na(x)` | returns TRUE or FALSE for each value in `x` |
| `anyNA(x)` | returns a single TRUE or FALSE |
| `na.rm = TRUE` | remove `NA` values when running function|



```{r}
x <- c(1, NA, 3)

is.na(x)
```

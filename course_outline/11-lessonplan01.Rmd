## Objectives

> The important thing is that you solve the problem that you’re working on, not write the most concise and elegant code (although that’s definitely something you want to strive towards!)
> - Grolemund & Wickham, _R for Data Science_

At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. Describe the fundamental elements of data manipulation,  

2. Demonstrate how these can be applied using R, and

3. Use the RStudio IDE.

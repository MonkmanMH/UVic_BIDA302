### 1. Plots, charts and other data visualizations


_Reading:_

* _R4DS_, ["Data visualisation"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)

* _R4DS_, ["Exploratory Data Analysis"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html)

* Kieran Healy, [_Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction_](http://socviz.co/) (draft version of the manuscript)

  - If I were teaching a 6-week course on data visualization, this book would be a required text. If you are making charts as part of your work or studies, I _strongly_ encourage you to read through Chapters 1-7! The book is very well laid-out, and includes great advice on good data visualization practice (see [Chapter 1, "Look at data"](http://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata))  
  
  - For this class, we will focus on [8. "Refine your plots"](http://socviz.co/refineplots.html#refineplots)
  



### 2. Modeling, forecasting & what-if scenario analysis


_Reading:_

* _R4DS_, section IV Model:

  - ["Model - Introduction"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html) 
  - ["Model Basics"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html), and 
  - ["Model building"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-building.html)

* Stefano Rizzi, ["What-If Analysis"](http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/~srizzi/PDF/eds-WIA.pdf), 

* [Introduction to What-If Analysis](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/introduction-to-what-if-analysis-22bffa5f-e891-4acc-bf7a-e4645c446fb4) -- for Microsoft Excel



### 3. Iteration


_Reading:_

* _R4DS_, ["Iteration"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) 



### 4. Python as data analysis tool


_Reading and Resources:_

**SciPy**

(https://www.scipy.org/) -- [SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.]

The core packages include:

[**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -- data structures and analysis

* [10 minutes to pandas¶](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) -- "a short introduction to pandas, geared mainly for new users."

* [data wrangling with pandas cheat sheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)


[**Matplotlib**: Visualization with Python](https://matplotlib.org/)


[**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/) -- Base N-dimensional array package


See also: 

**ggplot**

* [ggplot from ŷhat](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) -- "ggplot is a plotting system for Python based on R's ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics. It is built for making profressional looking, plots quickly with minimal code."

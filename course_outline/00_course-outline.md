# Data Analytics & Coding Fundamentals: BIDA302

Januar 8–February 13, 2022

* Saturday and Sunday, 9:00 am–12:00 pm Pacific


Classes will be held via Zoom meeting.

  - Step 1: Sign in via [uvic.zoom.us](https://uvic.zoom.us/) using your UVic
    Netlink ID

## Prerequisites

None.

## Course description

This course will explore the fundamentals of coding and scripting for Data Analytics. You will develop the ability to script and code for basic tasks in Data Analytics in common data analytic tools such as R, Python, and Excel. This will allow you to import and export data appropriately and perform fundamental data manipulations and to automate basic analysis elements.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

  - Perform basic data manipulations

  - Create variables

  - Apply key concepts of variables, constants and functions

  - Calculate descriptive statistics

  - Perform basic logical formula functions

  - Group and ungroup data

  - Data Importing

  - Data Exporting

  - Extract and combine data

  - Create what-if scenarios

## Continuing Studies Statement on Use of Educational Technology

This course will require the use of RStudio Cloud and may use other
education technology such as internet-based applications, cloud
services, or social media. In order to complete this course you will be
required to either consent to the disclosure of your personal
information outside of Canada to enable use of these technologies, or
work with the instructor to use other privacy protective options (such
as using an alias or nickname).

## Course Philosophy

Analysis of data helps us make better decisions. And computers have
accelerated how much data we can analyze.

We can do data analysis using GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools, such
as Excel or Tableau. But using a programing language to write code that
generates your analysis will make you more efficient and effective, open
up a universe of additional functionality, and make your analysis
workflow:

  - reproducible and auditable,

  - accurate, and

  - collaborative.

The emphasis in this course will be on analytic methods, coding
concepts, and programming practice that are universal; you will be able
to apply them in whatever analytic setting you find yourself, and are
independent of the tool you’ll be using.

By the end of this course, you will see the relationship between your
raw data and the table, plot, or model you want to create, and use a
variety of functions to achieve that transformation.

In this course we will be primarily using the open source programming
language R, with tangents into data analysis coding in Excel and Python.

Here’s another course description, one that I really like, so (with the
author’s permission) I am including it here:

> Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and
> scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have
> overtaken older (and expensive\!) corporate software packages like SAS
> and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and
> other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze
> pretty much any kind of data.

> This class will expose you to R—one of the most popular, sought-after,
> and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the
> foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough
> to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in
> the future.

## Evaluation

### Class participation (marks: 10)

  - attendance

  - doing the readings

  - asking questions and responding to the questions of others

  - participating in zoom break-out groups

  - collaborating with other participants

### Weekly assignments (marks: 12 each, 48 total)

  - Four assignments, due Weeks 2 through 5.

  - These four assignments will review the concepts introduced in that
    week’s lesson and build on previous concepts.

  - The assignments will be introduced and discussed at the end of the
    week’s lesson; there may be time to work on the assignment in-class.

  - There will be no “weekly assignment” introduced in week 5 and to
    hand in at Week 6, because you’ll be working on your Capstone
    Project that week.

  - **Due date:** Each assignment is due at 23:59 (11:59 pm) on the
    Thursday following the class; late assignments will be accepted
    until 23:59 (11:59 pm) on the Friday following the class. Anything later
    than that will not be accepted, as we will review the assignment
    during Saturday’s class.

### Additional optional stretch assignments (marks: 0)

  - These *optional* assignments will give you the opportunity for
    additional practice and to flex your developing coding muscles.

  - They are optional.

### Capstone Project (marks: 40)

  - A small project that will require the application of all of the
    concepts introduced
    
      - importing data
    
      - data wrangling
    
      - data modeling and summarization
    
      - communication (including visualization)

  - The project will be introduced in Week 4.

  - Some projects will be available for you to choose from, but you may
    also bring your own data.

## Pep Talk\!

“Smart people ask stupid questions.” (Source unknown)

Any language, computer or human, can be a challenge to learn. We bring
our established ways of thinking, and another language won’t always
conform to those ideas. For example, French has gendered nouns—for
example, *le pot* (pot or drink) and *la peau* (skin)—and English does
not. For an English-speaker, this can be frustrating\!

One of the most important developers of R packages (and co-author of our
textbook), Hadley Wickham, was recently [quoted in an
interview](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

> **It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated
> and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to
> program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets
> frustrated.** I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code.
> It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone
> and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a
> break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

## Some advice from people who took BIDA302 before…

People who have previously taken this course were asked “Imagine that
time travel is possible…You have just been transported back four weeks
to the day before this course started. What is one thing you would tell
your past self about this course?” Here are some of their answers:

  - It won’t be as scary as you think it will be.

  - It is fun\! Keep up\!

  - You’ll get better soon.

  - Need to spend more time studying since the class is 6 hours a week,
    1-2 hours a week outside class won’t be enough for a dinosaur like
    me.

  - To do the homework on Saturday\* after class so you haven’t
    forgotten everything\!

  - **Reading the textbook will help you, use it.**
    
      - Review the data before starting to work with it. It helps to
        understand what the data is, how it might be used.
    
      - Review the material in the Saturday\* lesson as you will need it
        for the assignment.
    
      - If you start having to use functions you aren’t familiar with,
        you’re on the wrong track.
    
      - Keep it simple, and then add on as you go.

  - Be confident in yourself and make sure you read the textbook\!

  - The learning curve is the steepest on day one\! Just because you’ve
    never programmed before doesn’t mean you are a lost cause and won’t
    be able to succeed. Take a deep breath, experiment, and revel in the
    feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment when R finally executes
    your code and doesn’t spit out another error message\!
    
      - P.S. Googling the Error Message may not be a real book, but
        Google will definitely offer up helpful message boards and
        YouTube tutorials from friendly members of the R community.
    
      - P.P.S. Start an R Notebook and work out the problems in the R
        for Data Science textbook as you read the relevant chapters.
        Practice is the best way to learn programming.

  - Prepare to learn lots about R and RStudio. …And bring coffee\!

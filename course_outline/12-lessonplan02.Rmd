# Week 2 


>The data may not contain the answer. The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.
>
>- John Tukey



At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. Describe the fundamental elements of data manipulation, 

2. Demonstrate how these can be applied in a data analytics context,

3. Successfully import CSV and Excel files into R.

### Readings from _R4DS_

Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

* [12. Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), sections 12.1 to 12.3

* [11. Import data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html)


#### Tidy data

More about tidy data:

[Reshaping Your Data with tidyr](https://uc-r.github.io/tidyr), UC Business Analytics R Programming Guide

* this article uses the old {tidyr} `gather()` and `spread()` functions instead of `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, but it's got some good material on how to think about how and why data needs to be reshaped.

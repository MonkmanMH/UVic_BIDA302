# Introduction to data visualization {#data-viz}

## Setup

This chunk of R code loads the packages that we will be using.

```{r, setup_300, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```




## Anscombe's Quartet


"Anscombe's Quartet" comprises four data sets that each have eleven rows, each with two variables (_x_ and _y_). The quartet was constructed by Francis Anscombe, and published in a 1973 paper titled ["Graphs in Statistical Analysis" in the journal _American Statistician_](https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/anscombe1973.pdf)[@Anscombe_1973].

The quartet is included in base R, but in an untidy format:

```{r}
anscombe
```


Read the quartet data in a tidy form.^[Source: David Robinson, ["Anscombe’s Quartet with Tidy Tools"](https://rpubs.com/dgrtwo/tidy-anscombe)] Note that the variables have been renamed "ex" and "why".



```{r, echo = FALSE}
## old-school `gather()` and `spread()`
#anscombe_tidy <- anscombe %>%
#  mutate(observation = seq_len(n())) %>%
#  gather(key, value, -observation) %>%
#  separate(key, c("variable", "set"), 1, convert = TRUE) %>%
#  mutate(set = c("I", "II", "III", "IV")[set]) %>%
#  spread(variable, value) %>%
#  arrange(set)
#anscombe_tidy
#write_csv(anscombe_tidy, "anscombe_tidy.csv")
#
```


```{r anscombe_tidy}
anscombe_tidy <- read_csv("data/anscombe_tidy.csv")

anscombe_tidy
```



### Summary statistics

Each of the four sets in Anscombe's Quartet has the same summary statistics. Let's calculate the mean of _ex_ for each of the four sets:


```{r, anscombe_summary_stats1}
# example
anscombe_tidy %>%
  group_by(set) %>%
  summarize(mean_ex = mean(ex))
```

::: {.rmdtip}
#### Exercise

Using the following functions, calculate the summary statistics of _ex_ and _why_, and the correlation coefficient between _ex_ and _why_, for all four of the sets in the quartet:

 | statistic | function |
 | ----       | ----      |
 | mean      | mean()   |
 | standard deviation | sd() |
 | correlation coefficient | cor() |
 
 
<details>

<summary>
Solution
</summary>

To create a table with these statistics by the four sets, we first `group_by()` and then `summarize()` (or `summarise()`). Notice that we include all of the calculations within a single `summarize()` function.

```{r, anscombe_summary_stats2}
# solution
anscombe_tidy %>% 
  group_by(set) %>% 
  summarize(mean(ex), 
            sd(ex), 
            mean(why), 
            sd(why), 
            cor(ex, why))

```

## Visualizing the quartet

Using the R visualization package {ggplot2}.

The template of a `ggplot()` function call looks like this:

`ggplot(data = <DATA>) + ` <BR>
`  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))`  

We use:

* the `data =` argument to name the dataframe we are using.

* the `<GEOM_FUNCTION>` to define how we want the data represented (as points, or lines, or bars, or...).

* the `mapping =` is where we define which variables we want plotted, and 

* the `aes()` (for "aesthetic") includes _how_ we want those plotted.


### Scatter plot



With this example, the dataframe we're using is `anscombe_tidy` and we are plotting `ex` and `why` as points in a scatter plot.

```{r}
# example
ggplot(anscombe_tidy) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = ex, y = why)) 
```



Now we will add another variable to those in our `aes` list. We will add the variable "set", and use `colour` to differentiate each value within "set". You will notice that the `colour =` specification goes _inside_ the `aes()`—we are using colour to represent the variable "set".

```{r}
# example
ggplot(anscombe_tidy) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = ex, y = why, colour = set)) 
```


For the example below, we plot only set "I". We start with our `anscombe_tidy` dataframe, and then using the pipe symbol, first `filter()` and then pass the results of the filter to our `ggplot()` function. Note that because the filtered dataframe is being passed, there is no specified `data =` in the `ggplot()` function: the data to be plotted is what is passed after the previous step in the pipe.

You will notice that the arguments `aes()` and `x =` etc are not specified. As we saw in earlier examples, if the arguments are in the order that the function expects, they are interpreted correctly.

In this example, the code increases the size of the points and colours them purple. These arguments are _outside_ the `aes()` argument, so they apply to all of the points.

```{r}
# solution
anscombe_tidy %>%
  filter(set == "I") %>%
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(ex, why), size = 3, colour = "purple")
```


### Facet plot


Another way to differentiate the sets is to use a facet plot. In this example, we use the function `facet_wrap`. 

```{r, anscombe_facet1}
ggplot(anscombe_tidy) + 
  geom_point(aes(ex, why)) + 
  facet_wrap(~set)
```


Now we will add a trend line using the `geom_smooth` function.

* the `method = lm` indicates a "linear model", i.e. a standard regression line. (We will come back to the statistics that underlie this function in [Modeling].) {ggplot2} provides access to other smoothing algorithms.

* the `se = FALSE` turns off the "standard error" (a measure of uncertainty in the data)

```{r, anscombe_facet2}
ggplot(anscombe_tidy) + 
  geom_point(aes(ex, why)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(ex, why), method = lm) +
  facet_wrap(~set)
```


But that duplicates the `aes(ex, why)` text...so we can move that into the `ggplot()` function. That way, the aesthetics apply to each of the `geom_` calls.


```{r, anscombe_facet3}
p <- ggplot(anscombe_tidy, aes(ex, why)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~set)
p
```

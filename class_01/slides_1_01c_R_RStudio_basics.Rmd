# Console

## R as calculator

Type in the console window:

`10 + 4`

---
class: inverse

# The power of named variables |  Creating a named object 

## the assignment arrow

`<-`

First: create a new R script file


## assign the object "x" with the value 10

`x <- 10` 

--

> To show `x` in the console, just type `x`


---
class: inverse

> How would you create a new object "y" with the value 4?

--
`y <- 4`


> Now add x and y

--


`x + y`

> Did you notice the change in the Environment pane?


---
class: inverse

# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

--

`x <- 20`

--

# And now divide `x` by `y`

`x / y`

---
class: inverse

`t <- "If it's inside quotation marks, it's a character"`


Now print the object `t`

## Vector -- a series of values

`x <- 1:10`

# {tidyverse} -

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

The [{tidyverse} site](https://tidyverse.org)

***

Two tidyerse packages we will be using today:

{dplyr} - data wrangling
{tidyr} - to pivot (spread and gather) data tables
{mpg} - contains a dataframe.

# Quick Detour: getting help

Typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing, which often shows many other things!

---
class: inverse

## Quick Detour: Sources of help

* `?package` or `?function`

* package page and vignettes

* cheat sheets

* Stack Overflow

* blogs

# Quick Detour: some helpful base R functions

```{r}
View(mpg)       ## opens data to view, too big to show here

names(mpg)      ## lists the names of all variables in dataset

summary(mpg)    ## provides statistical summary of data

```

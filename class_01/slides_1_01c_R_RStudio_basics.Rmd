# Console

## R as calculator

Type in the console window:

`10 + 4`

First create a new R script file

# The power of named variables 

## the assignment arrow

`<-`

class: inverse

## assign the object "x" with the value 10

`x <- 10` 

--

> To show `x` in the console, just type `x`


---
class: inverse

> How would you create a new object "y" with the value 4?

--
`y <- 4`


> Now add x and y

--


`x + y`

> Did you notice the change in the Environment pane?

class: inverse

# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

--

`x <- 20`

--

# And now divide `x` by `y`

`x / y`

`t <- "If it's inside quotation marks, it's a character"`


Now print the object `t`

# Quick Detour: functions for objects

|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| `ls()`    | *list objects*|
| `str()`    | *display structure of object*|
| `ls.str()`    | *list objects and their structure*|
| `names()`    | *display structure of object*|

Try these functions on the object `t` you created

# {tidyverse} -

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

The [{tidyverse} site](https://tidyverse.org)

***

Two tidyerse packages we will be using today:

{dplyr} - data wrangling
{tidyr} - to pivot (spread and gather) data tables
{mpg} - contains a dataframe.

# Quick Detour: getting help

Typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing, which often shows many other things!

---
class: inverse

## Quick Detour: Sources of help

* `?package` or `?function`

* package page and vignettes

* cheat sheets

* Stack Overflow

* blogs

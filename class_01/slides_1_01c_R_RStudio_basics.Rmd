# R

![R logo](../img/R.jpg)

Data science / statistics programming language

# RStudio

Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

(walk through the panes)

---

# rstudio.cloud

web-based version


---

# Console

## R as calculator

Type in the console window:

`10 + 4`

---

# The power of named variables |  Creating a named object 

## the assignment arrow

`<-`

First: create a new R script file


## assign the object "x" with the value 10
`x <- 10` 

--

How would you create a new object "y" with the value 4?

--
`y <- 4`


Now add x and y

--


`x + y`

--

did you notice the change in the Environment pane?


---

# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

--

x <- 20

--

# And now divide `x` by `y`

x / y


---

# Packages

R uses “packages” to extend the functionality

# {tidyverse} -

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

The [{tidyverse} site](https://tidyverse.org)

***

Two tidyerse packages we will be using today:

{dplyr} - data wrangling
{tidyr} - to pivot (spread and gather) data tables
{mpg} - contains a dataframe.

# Quick Detour: getting help

Typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing, which often shows many other things!

---

# FUnctions

`function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)`


---

# Quick Detour: some helpful base R functions

```{r}
View(mpg)       ## opens data to view, too big to show here

names(mpg)      ## lists the names of all variables in dataset

summary(mpg)    ## provides statistical summary of data

```

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
# data packages
library(gapminder)

```


## Your Turn 4.1

{gapminder} again

```{r}
gapminder
```

Using `select()` to reduce the number of variables:

```{r}
gapminder %>%                                
  select(country, year, lifeExp) 

```



You can use the minus sign to drop variable--that is, to define ones to _not_ select. 

In this example, note we have to use `c()` to create a list:


```{r}
gapminder %>%                                
  select(-(c(continent, pop, gdpPercap))) 

```



You can define a range of columns to select by using the `:`

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  select(country, year:pop)
```



***

# Take aways

* Restructure data frames with `select()` and `pull()`  
* Reinforce other data transformation functions

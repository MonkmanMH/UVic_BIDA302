A pivot table crosstab using the {mpg} data package of automobile fuel economy.

First, a look at the source table.



---

Using `group_by` and `summarise` to create a summary table of the average engine displacement:

```{r}
mpg %>%                                
  group_by(class) %>%                   
  summarise(displ_mean = mean(displ)) 

```

---

Now do the same with vehicle class and number of cylinders:

```{r}

class_by_cyl <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class, cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(displ)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean))

class_by_cyl

```

---


What happens if you reverse the order of the grouping variables?

---

Create a pivot (crosstab) table with class by number of cylinders:


using `pivot_wider()`

```{r}
class_by_cyl_pivot <- class_by_cyl %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = cyl, values_from = mean)


class_by_cyl_pivot
```

---

# and back to longer...

```{r}

class_by_cyl_pivot %>%
  pivot_longer(-class, names_to = "cyl", values_to = "mean")

```


---

Note that `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` are new functions, introduced earlier this year.

_R for Data Science_ uses the terms `spread()` and `gather()`, the older {tidyr} functions that do the same thing.

For example, `spread()` to replicate the `pivot_wider()` function:

```{r}

class_by_cyl %>%
  spread(cyl, value = mean)

```

---

## Manipulate variables 
##(back to {dplyr})

You've already seen `mutate()` to calculate new variables for your dataframe. What if you want to remove some variables?

---

Using `select()` to reduce the number of variables:

```{r}
gapminder %>%                                
  select(country, year, lifeExp) 

```

---


You can use the minus sign to drop variable--that is, to define ones to _not_ select. 

In this example, note we have to use `c()` to create a list:

```{r}
gapminder %>%                                
  select(-c(continent, pop, gdpPercap))

```

---


You can define a range of columns to select:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  select(country, year:pop)
```

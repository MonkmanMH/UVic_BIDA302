## Your Turn 3.1

Create a table where:

* object name `lifeExp_by_continent` that has 
* the median life expectency for each continent for every year in the dataframe, 
* where the continent is the column and the year is the row.

(This is a restructuring of the table from 2.4)

```{r}


```

## Your Turn 3.2

Create a table that shows:

* GDP per capita for
* the countries Canada, United States, and Mexico are the columns, and 
* the years after 1980 are the rows

```{r}



```

# Take aways

* Restructure data tabulations with `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer`

# Introduction

This is a minimal example to demonstrate how to create a flipbook that will walk through data wrangling and plots pipelines made with the Tidyverse.  The functions that make this possible are the work of Emi Tanaka, Garrick Aden-Buie and myself, and are built for Xaringan, an Rmarkdown file type for creating presentation slides; the functions make use of the function `knitr:::knit_code$get()`.

The sequential workflow of the Tidyverse makes incremental display of pipelines ideal:

# Set up

Okay. Let's load the the `reveal for xaringan` functions for "flipbooking" and the `tidyverse`.

```{r}
if(file.exists("../xaringan_reveal_parentheses_balanced.R")){
  source(file = "../xaringan_reveal_parentheses_balanced.R")
  
} else {
source(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/little_flipbooks_library/master/xaringan_reveal_parentheses_balanced.R")
  
}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

```{r}
gapminder_2007 <- 
  gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
```

# Where we are going: 

We'll create this plot.  I have **echo** set to FALSE in the code chunk options here so that you don't see the code, and **eval** to TRUE so that the plot output is produced.  The code chunk is given the name "gapminder2007", and this is used in the in apply_reveal function, which breaks down code by wrangling and plot statements. 

```{r gapminder2007, echo = F, eval = T, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007) + 
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +  # x axis 
  aes(y = lifeExp) +  # y axis
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = continent)
```
 

 
---

# How do we get there?

In the next slide, we'll walk through the code that produces this plot, and the output along the way. We use the code `apply_reveal("gapminder2007")` in-line to access the code from the code chunk called *gapminder2007*.
 
---

`r apply_reveal("gapminder2007")`


---

# Other pipeline connectors

The reveal functions are also written to recognize the pipe, `%>%`, and reverse assignment operator `->`, at the end of a line as reveal break points.  An example follows. 

```{r gapminder2007pipe, echo = F, eval = T, fig.height=5}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = gdpPercap) + 
  aes(y = lifeExp) + 
  geom_point() +
  aes(col = continent) -> 
  g
```


---

`r apply_reveal("gapminder2007pipe", title = "# Hey")`

---

# Hide code

You might be interested in showing the evolution of a plot, without focusing on the code. Let's see an example of this.  

Consider the case where you want to show the x-axis, then add the y-axis, show one data point, and then add the rest of the data.  

Building up plots slowly in presentations has been a technique employed by Hans Rosling and Mona Chalabi.  Matthew Blackwell tweeted this advice in 2018 -- it resonated with a lot of folks!


---

To do this, we prep a code chunk with our plot, defining where we want breaks in display to come with the statement **#REVEAL** at the end of the key lines.  


```{r, gapminder2007plotonly, eval = F}
gapminder %>%              # Prep
  filter(year == 2007) %>% # Data
  ggplot() +      # pipe to ggplot
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  # prep x axis
  aes(x = gdpPercap) + 
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita ($US)") + #REVEAL
  # prep y axis
  aes(y = lifeExp) + 
  labs(y = "Life Expectency") + 
  geom_blank() + # keep all points  #REVEAL
  # plot one point
  geom_point(data = gapminder_2007 %>% 
               filter(country == "Spain")) + #REVEAL
  # plot rest of points
  geom_point() #REVEAL
```
---

Then, we'll use the name of this code chunk in a reveal function "apply_reveal", with `show_code` set to F, and `user_reveal_defined` set to T.  

---

`r apply_reveal(chunk_name = "gapminder2007plotonly", user_reveal_defined = T, show_code = F, title = "# My Title")`



```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = F}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 100%}
```

# 1. Plotting


## a short example


At the end of this section, you will have plotted some gapminder data to produce this chart:

![Hans Rosling, aging Europe 1961](../img/Hans_Rosling_aging_europe.JPG)

Or, more precisely:

```{r}

```

I downloaded the data tables from https://www.gapminder.org/data/, for 

* Population, total

* Population, aged 60+

* Babies per woman (total fertility)

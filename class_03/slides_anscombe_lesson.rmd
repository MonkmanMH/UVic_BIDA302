# Anscombe's Quartet

### "A computer should make both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of outputs should be studied; each will contribute to understanding."

- F.J. Anscombe, "Graphs in Statistical Analysis", 1973

# The Quartet

.pull-left[

### Four data sets

- each set has 11 pairs of _x_ and _y_ values

]

.pull-right[

### Identical summary statistics:

- N = 11
- Mean of x = 9.0
- Mean of y = 7.5
- Multiple R2 = 0.667
- Regression equation: y = 3 + 0.5x
- And other statistical summary measures are also identical

# The Exercise


### Read data into Excel

### Calculate:

- Means of _x_ and _y_ values

- Multiple R<sup>2</sup>

### Visualize each set:

- Scatterplot (a.k.a. _x/y_ plot)

- Scatterplot with trend line and regression equation

# Step 1: read the data

.pull-left[

Open Excel

- File / Open / anscombe.csv

- may need to set file type to "Text Files"

# This is a banner slide

## h2 for medium headings

### h3 for small headings

#### h4 for pale smallest headings

This is text

- this is a bullet


code:

## add slides 

- pure white background

#### slides with banners 


- "fafaff" banner with eigengrau body

---

#### punch colours

- need some thematically consistent highlight colours

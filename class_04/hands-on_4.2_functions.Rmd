## Objectives

* Understand and describe when and why a function is of value

* Understand the components of a function



![what's your function?](../img/shr_function.jpg)


Functions are an important part of programming in R. You have already used many functions ... now it's time to write your own.

Functions have particular value in making your code DRY (don't repeat yourself). If you need to do the same thing over and over again (whether in this script, or next month / quarter), you can either copy-and-paste with some find-and-replace, or take the time to write a generalized function. 

Using functions has the following benefits: 

* there's fewer opportunities for error (say, you miss a replacement)

* your code will be better organized and easier to read


There are three parts to any function:

* function name  
* inputs, which are called "arguments"  
* code statement(s) that do something with/to the argument(s)  

The code looks like this:

```{r evaluate = FALSE}
my.function.name <- function(my_argument_1, my_argument_2, ...) {
  code_statement
}
```

## 1. A simple example

(from ["Writing your own Functions" in _Hands-on Programming with R_](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html#write-functions), by Garrett Grolemund)


Let's say you want to simulate rolling 2 six-sided dice. Here's some code that does that:

```{r}
# define the possible outcomes
die <- 1:6
# a random pair of numbers from the `die` object
dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
# then add them up
sum(dice)

```


To do this more than once, you would need to write the last two lines of code in again and again:

```{r}

dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
sum(dice)

dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
sum(dice)

dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
sum(dice)


```


_Or_ you could write a function.

In this case, our code_statement is the three lines of code:


```{r}

roll <- function() {
  die <- 1:6
  dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}

```


Note that when we run this chunk, the function gets stored in our environment, and appears under Functions.

To run the function we just need the following:

```{r}

roll()

```



## 2. A more complex example

Let's write an equation that calculates the area of a circle that has a radius of 2.5 units.

You'll remember that the formula is "pi r squared" where r is the radius of the circle.

$$\ A = \pi r ^{2} $$

Our formula looks like this, where `ca` is "circle area":

```{r}

ca <- pi * 2.5 ^ 2

ca

```


But what if we have many circles of different size? Time for a function.

We call the function with `circle_area()`, and pass the radius value `r`.

```{r}

circle_area <- function(r) {
  ca <- pi * r ^ 2
  return(ca)
}


circle_area(2.5)

```


Now we can use that function to calculate any number of circle areas. Let's say we have a tibble with 26 circles, where `circle_r` is the radius of each circle.

```{r}

my_circles <- tibble(
  circle_name = letters[1:10], 
  circle_r = seq(1, 19, 2))

my_circles

```

What is the area of those circles? I can apply my function...

```{r}

my_circles %>%
  mutate(circle_a = circle_area(circle_r))

```

But what if we want our result to be rounded to 2 decimal places?

We could rewrite our function to add that:

* note that there is now an object `ca` that is used to pass values along to the next line in the function. It's `ca` that gets rounded in the 2nd line.


```{r}

circle_area <- function(r) {
  ca <- pi * r ^ 2
  ca <- round(ca, 2)
  return(ca)
}

```

Now re-run the `mutate()`:


```{r}

my_circles %>%
  mutate(circle_a = circle_area(circle_r))

```


What if we want want to have some flexibility in our rounding? We can add a 2nd argument to our function call -- `rnd` -- which will be then applied in `round()`


```{r}

circle_area <- function(r, rnd) {
  ca <- pi * r ^ 2
  ca <- round(ca, rnd)
  return(ca)
}

```


And rerun:

```{r}

my_circles %>%
  mutate(circle_a = circle_area(circle_r, 4))

```


Setting default values:

What if we usually want to round to 2, but to have some flexibility? We can assign the default value of 2 to the rounding, so that if it doesn't get specified, it will be 2 ... but we can over-ride that with a specific call

```{r}

circle_area <- function(r, rnd = 2) {
  ca <- pi * r ^ 2
  ca <- round(ca, rnd)
  return(ca)
}

```


With no specification:

```{r}

my_circles %>%
  mutate(circle_a = circle_area(circle_r))

```


Or override with rounding to 3 decimals:


```{r}

my_circles %>%
  mutate(circle_a = circle_area(circle_r, 3))

```

## Your turn 1

Write a function that calculates the area of a triangle, using the formula 

$$\ A = hb/2$$
where "h" is the height of the triangle, and "b" is the base.

Now, write and test a function to calculate the area of a triangle. The function for a circle is pasted below:


```{r}

circle_area <- function(r, rnd = 2) {
  ca <- pi * r ^ 2
  ca <- round(ca, rnd)
  return(ca)
}

```



```{r}
# solution
tri_area <- function(h, b, rnd = 2) {
  ta <- (h * b) / 2
  ta <- round(ta, rnd)
  return(ta)
}

```


Now, read in the CSV file "my_triangles.csv":

```{r}

# solution
my_triangles <- read_csv("my_triangles.csv")

```


```{r}
my_triangles %>% 
  mutate(tri_a = tri_area(tri_h, tri_b))
```

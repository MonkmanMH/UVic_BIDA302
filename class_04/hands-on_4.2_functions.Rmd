## Objectives

* Understand and describe when and why a function is of value

* Understand the components of a function



![what's your function?](../img/shr_function.jpg)


Functions are an important part of programming in R. You have already used many functions ... now it's time to write your own.

Functions have particular value in making your code DRY (don't repeat yourself). If you need to do the same thing over and over again (whether in this script, or next month / quarter), you can either copy-and-paste with a few changes, or take the time to write a generalized function. 

With a function, there's fewer opportunities for error (say you miss a replacement)

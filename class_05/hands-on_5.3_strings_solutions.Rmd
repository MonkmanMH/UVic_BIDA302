```{r setup}

library(stringr)
```



## Objectives

* Understand the basics of regular expressions (regexps)

* Understand basic functions in {stringr} for working with functions

* Demonstrate ability to use those functions


## Strings

Characters, numbers, etc

```{r}

string1 <- "This is my 1st string!"

string1

```

## Regular expressions

See https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html

Also, as a handy tool: https://regex101.com/



## Special characters

**quotes**

Single and double quotes need to be "escaped" with a `\`

```{r}

double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"

double_quote
single_quote

```


* to see a representation of the string as it will print, use the function `writeLines()`

```{r}

writeLines(double_quote)

```



```{r}

string2 <- 'The 2nd string has a "quote" so it is inside single quotes'

string2

writeLines(string2)

```


**other special characters**

These also need to be escaped:

| character | what it is |
| ---- | ---- |
| "\\" | backslash |
| "\n" | new line (line break) |
| "\t" | tab |
| "\u..." | unicode characters* |


* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters

See the help function for `?'"'`

```{r}
interrobang <- "\u2048"
interrobang

```


To make a shruggie, you need to escape the backslash

```{r}

shruggie <- glue::glue("¯\\_(ツ)_/¯")
shruggie

shruggie <- glue::glue("¯\\", "_(ツ)_", "/¯")
shruggie

```





## Basic functions in {stringr}.
 

![stringr hex](..\img\stringr_300.png)


```{r string_length}

x <- c("Sly", "Billie", "Thelonious", "Maroon", "Willie", "Led")
x
str_length(x) 

```


use `str_c` to collapse list into one string

```{r str_c}

str_c(x, collapse = ", ")

```


---

## Combining strings

Use `str_c` to join two character vectors, separated by a space


```{r str_c_2}


y <- c("Stone", "Ellish", "Monk", "5", "Nelson", "Zeppelin")

str_c(x, y, sep = " ")

```

## Your turn 1.1

Now join `x` to `y`, separated by an apostrophe and a space

```{r your_turn_1.1}

#solution
str_c(y, x, sep = ", ")


```

---

## Pattern matching

Are there any vowels in the string? And count them:

```{r str_count}

str_detect(x, "[aeiou]")

str_count(x, "[aeiou]")

```

Are there any digits?

```{r}

str_detect(y, "\\d")

```




Extract chunks of text by their location: `str_sub(x, start, end)`


```{r str_sub}

str_sub(x, 1, 2)  


```


`str_locate()` finds the first position of the pattern:

```{r}

# look for pairs of vowels
str_locate(x, "[aeiou][aeiou]")

# look for a specific match ...
str_locate(x, "oo")

```


Extract the first case of a vowel:

```{r}

str_extract(x, "[aeiou]")

```

## Your turn 1.2

Extract the pairs of vowels:

```{r}
# solution
str_extract(x, "[aeiou][aeiou]")

```

## Splitting strings

https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_split.html

function: `str_split()`


Back to the various ways dates are represented: if it's a character string with the month and year.

"Jan 2019"

```{r}

our_date <- "Jan 2019"


lubridate::ymd(our_date)


```

So that doesn't work.

We can split the string into two parts using `str_split()`, where we specify the space as the splitting element:

```{r}

str_split(our_date, " ")

```

Here we have four month-years, arranged alphabetically:

```{r}

four_dates <- tribble(~ref_date, "Dec 2019", "Feb 2020", "Jan 2018", "Mar 2021")

four_dates <- four_dates %>% 
  mutate(value = 1:4)

four_dates

```

Inside a tibble, we use `separate()` from the {tidyr} package:

* https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html

```{r}

four_dates2 <- four_dates %>% 
  separate(ref_date, into = c("ref_mon", "ref_year"), sep = " ")

four_dates2

```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6549239/convert-months-mmm-to-numeric


Back to factors!

```{r}

# create a list that will be the month levels:

month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)


four_dates3 <- four_dates2 %>% 
  mutate(ref_mon2 = factor(ref_mon, levels = month_levels)) %>%
  arrange(ref_mon2)

four_dates3

```


```{r}

four_dates_list <- four_dates3 %>% 
  glue::glue_data("{ref_year}-{ref_mon2}-01")

four_dates_list

```


Now it's in a format that {lubridate} can understand, and convert to a <date> class:

```{r}


ymd(four_dates_list)

```


And here's three different ways to add our new list back onto the data table:

```{r}
# in a pipe:
four_dates3 %>% 
  mutate(ref_date_x = ymd(four_dates_list))

# for fans of the <table>$<variable> structure:
four_dates3$ref_date_y <- ymd(four_dates_list)

# and a new function, `cbind()`:
cbind(four_dates3, ymd(four_dates_list))

```


For more on `cbind()` (for column bind) and its parallel `rbind()` (for row bind), see:

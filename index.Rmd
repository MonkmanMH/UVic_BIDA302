_Draft_

This book is based on the lessons for BIDA302, "Data Analytics Coding Fundamentals", offered at the University of Victoria's [Continuing Studies Department](https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/).


### Course description {-}

From [UVic Continuing Studies website](https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/business-technology-and-public-relations/courses/data-analytics-coding-fundamentals)

> This course will explore the fundamentals of coding and scripting for Data Analytics. You will develop the ability to script and code for basic tasks in Data Analytics in common data analytic tools such as R, Python, and Excel. This will allow you to import and export data appropriately and perform fundamental data manipulations and to automate basic analysis elements.

Note that the emphasis of the course will be learning R. The concepts learned in that programming language can be applied in others; we will explore similar functions in Python towards the end of the course.

#### Learning objectives {-}

Additional readings and reference material are noted in each section, and included in the comprehensive bibliography.


### Code of Conduct {-}

The [R Consortium and R Community Code of Conduct](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct) serves well for us. This class,

> like the R community as a whole, is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth.

Please 

>follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep R a positive, successful, and growing community.

>**R Community Code of Conduct**
>
>A member of the R Community is:
>
>**Open**: Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on projects, working groups, packages, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of anyone who wishes to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where all can participate and everyone can make a difference.
>
>**Considerate**: Members of the community are considerate of their peers — other R users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that oftentimes the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
>
>**Respectful**: Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the R community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
>
>Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.




## Course Philosophy {-}

Analysis of data helps us make better decisions. And computers have
accelerated how much data we can analyze.

We can do data analysis using GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools, such
as Excel or Tableau. But using a programming language to write code that
generates your analysis will make you more efficient and effective, open
up a universe of additional functionality, and make your analysis
workflow:

  - reproducible and auditable,

  - accurate, and

  - collaborative.

The emphasis in this course will be on analytic methods, coding
concepts, and programming practice that are universal; you will be able
to apply them in whatever analytic setting you find yourself, and are
independent of the tool you’ll be using.

By the end of this course, you will see the relationship between your
raw data and the table, plot, or model you want to create, and use a
variety of functions to achieve that transformation.

In this course we will be primarily using the open source programming
language R, with tangents into data analysis coding in Excel and Python.

Here’s another course description, one that I really like, so (with the
author’s permission) I am including it here:

> Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and
> scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have
> overtaken older (and expensive\!) corporate software packages like SAS
> and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and
> other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze
> pretty much any kind of data.

> This class will expose you to R—one of the most popular, sought-after,
> and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the
> foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough
> to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in
> the future.

### On learning a new language {-}

"Smart people ask stupid questions." (Source unknown)

Any language, computer or human, can be a challenge to learn. We bring our established ways of thinking, and another language won't always conform to those ideas. For example, French has gendered nouns—for example, _le pot_ (pot or drink) and _la peau_ (skin)—and English does not. For an English-speaker, this can be frustrating!

One of the most important developers of R packages (and co-author of our textbook), Hadley Wickham, was recently [quoted in an interview](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

>**It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated.** I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

### Some advice from people who took BIDA302 before... {-}

People who have previously taken this course were asked “Imagine that
time travel is possible…You have just been transported back four weeks
to the day before this course started. What is one thing you would tell
your past self about this course?” Here are some of their answers:

  - It won’t be as scary as you think it will be.

  - It is fun\! Keep up\!

  - You’ll get better soon.

  - Need to spend more time studying since the class is 6 hours a week,
    1-2 hours a week outside class won’t be enough for a dinosaur like
    me.

  - To do the homework on Saturday\* after class so you haven’t
    forgotten everything\!

  - **Reading the textbook will help you, use it.**
    
      - Review the data before starting to work with it. It helps to
        understand what the data is, how it might be used.
    
      - Review the material in the Saturday\* lesson as you will need it
        for the assignment.
    
      - If you start having to use functions you aren’t familiar with,
        you’re on the wrong track.
    
      - Keep it simple, and then add on as you go.

  - Be confident in yourself and make sure you read the textbook\!

  - The learning curve is the steepest on day one\! Just because you’ve
    never programmed before doesn’t mean you are a lost cause and won’t
    be able to succeed. Take a deep breath, experiment, and revel in the
    feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment when R finally executes
    your code and doesn’t spit out another error message\!
    
      - P.S. Googling the Error Message may not be a real book, but
        Google will definitely offer up helpful message boards and
        YouTube tutorials from friendly members of the R community.
    
      - P.P.S. Start an R Notebook and work out the problems in the R
        for Data Science textbook as you read the relevant chapters.
        Practice is the best way to learn programming.

  - Prepare to learn lots about R and RStudio. …And bring coffee\!




## Structure {-}

The book's layout is in 6 sections, each corresponding to the 6 weeks of the course. Each week has multiple chapters, corresponding with the topics covered and (when appropriate) the assignment for that week.



## A bit about me {-}


* University: UVic Geography B.Sc. & M.A.

* Day job: BC Stats: 1993 to present (with 5 year gap when I worked elsewhere in the B.C. public service)

* I have been writing code since 1979

  - to do data analysis since 1993
  
  - using R since 2012

* My coding started writing [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) on [punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card)

  - I don't believe there is any benefit in learning things "the hard way" or "the way I learned it"
  
  - In this course we use much better technology that will allow you to do better data analysis more quickly than was possible when I started down this path

    abstract = { Abstract: Best practices in statistics and data science courses include the use of real and relevant data as well as teaching the entire data science cycle starting with importing data. A rich source of real and current data is the web, where data are often presented and stored in a structure that needs some wrangling and transforming before they can be ready for analysis. The web is a resource students naturally turn to for finding data for data analysis projects, but without formal instruction on how to get that data into a structured format, they often resort to copy-pasting or manual entry into a spreadsheet, which are both time consuming and error-prone. Teaching web scraping provides an opportunity to bring such data into the curriculum in an effective and efficient way. In this article, we explain how web scraping works and how it can be implemented in a pedagogically sound and technically executable way at various levels of statistics and data science curricula. We provide classroom activities where we connect this modern computing technique with traditional statistical topics. Finally, we share the opportunities web scraping brings to the classrooms as well as the challenges to instructors and tips for avoiding them. }

Abstract = {Rationale and objectives The availability of anonymized data is a keystone of medical research, yet little is known about lay views towards the process of anonymization or on the way that anonymized medical data are transferred to researchers. Methods During May and June 2009, as part of a wider consultation on methods for releasing data to researchers, three focus groups ( n = 19) were conducted exploring lay attitudes towards the traditional 'warehouse' model commonly used in medical research for delivering anonymized National Health Service (NHS) data to researchers. The focus groups explored different processes such as the copying of data, use of programmers for linkage and anonymization, the transfer of data and governance. Results The recognition of the positive aspects of medical research and desire to support it formed the context for discussions. Nonetheless, individuals varied in their attitudes to the use of anonymized data extracts for research from their health records},

abstract = {We distinguish diagrammatic from sentential paper-and-pencil representations of information by developing alternative models of information-processing systems that are informationally equivalent and that can be characterized as sentential or diagrammatic. Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Diagrammatic representations are indexed by location in a plane. Diagrammatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sentential representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representations for solving several illustrative problems in mathematics and physics. When two representations are informationally equivalent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their capabilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they can carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in particular, the control of search). Diagrammatic and sentential representations support operators that differ in all of these respects. Operators working on one representation may recognize features readily or make inferences directly that are difficult to realize in the other representation. Most important, however, are differences in the efficiency of search for information and in the explicitness of information. In the representations we call diagrammatic, information is organized by location, and often much of the information needed to make an inference is present and explicit at a single location. In addition, cues to the next logical step in the problem may be present at an adjacent location. Therefore problem solving can proceed through a smooth traversal of the diagram, and may require very little search or computation of elements that had been implicit.},

    abstract = { Health information technology has increased accessibility of health and medical data and benefited medical research and healthcare management. However, there are rising concerns about patient privacy in sharing medical and healthcare data. A large amount of these data are in free text form. Existing techniques for privacy-preserving data sharing deal largely with structured data. Current privacy approaches for medical text data focus on detection and removal of patient identifiers from the data, which may be inadequate for protecting privacy or preserving data quality. We propose a new systematic approach to extract, cluster, and anonymize medical text records. Our approach integrates methods developed in both data privacy and health informatics fields. The key novel elements of our approach include a recursive partitioning method to cluster medical text records based on the similarity of the health and medical information and a value-enumeration method to anonymize potentially identifying information in the text data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world medical documents. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. }

   abstract = {Data cleaning and validation are important steps in any data analysis, as the validity of the conclusions from the analysis hinges on the quality of the input data. Mistakes in the data can arise for any number of reasons, including erroneous codings, malfunctioning measurement equipment, and inconsistent data generation manuals. Ideally, a human investigator should go through each variable in the dataset and look for potential errors  -  both in input values and codings  -  but that process can be very time-consuming, expensive and error-prone in itself. We describe an R package, dataMaid, which implements an extensive and customizable suite of quality assessment aids that can be applied to a dataset in order to identify potential problems in its variables. The results are presented in an auto-generated, nontechnical, stand-alone overview document intended to be perused by an investigator with an understanding of the variables in the data, but not necessarily knowledge of R. Thereby, dataMaid aids the dialogue between data analysts and field experts, while also providing easy documentation of reproducible data quality screening. Moreover, the dataMaid solution changes the data screening process from the usual ad hoc approach to a systematic, well-documented endeavor. dataMaid also provides a suite of more typical R tools for interactive data quality assessment and screening, where the data inspections are executed directly in the R console.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the main advances in small area estimation (SAE) methods in recent years. We also discuss some of the earlier developments, which serve as a necessary background for the new studies. The review focuses on model dependent methods with special emphasis on point prediction of the target area quantities, and mean square error assessments. The new models considered are models used for discrete measurements, time series models and models that arise under informative sampling. The possible gains from modeling the correlations among small area random effects used to represent the unexplained variation of the small area target quantities are examined. For review and appraisal of the earlier methods used for SAE, see Ghosh & Rao (1994). /// Cette communication a pour but de fournir une revue des principaux développements des méthodes d'estimation pour les statistiques des petites régions, des années récentes. Nous discutons également des développements précédents, qui serviront d'arrière-plan pour les études nouvelles. La revue se concentre sur les méthodes basées sur les modèles et met le point surtout sur la prédiction ponctuelle des quantités des petites régions et l'estimation des erreurs carrées moyennes. Les nouveaux modèles considérés sont des modèles employés pour les mesures discrètes, des modèles de séries temporelles et des modèles produits sous l'échantillonnage informatif. On examine aussi les bénéfices possibles de l'emploi des modèles pour décrire les corrélations entre les effets aléatoires des petites régions, afin de représenter la variation inexpliquée entre ces quantités. Une revue et une évaluation des méthodes employées antérieurement pour les statistiques des petites régions sont présentées par Ghosh & Rao (1994).},

A quality perspective in data resource management is critical. Because users have different criteria for determining the quality of data, we propose tagging data at the cell level with quality indicators, which are objective characteristics of the data and its manufacturing process. Based on these indicators, the user may assess the data's quality for the intended application. This paper investigates how such quality indicators may be specified, stored, retrieved, and processed. We propose an attribute-based data model, query algebra, and integrity rules that facilitate cell-level tagging as well as the processing of application data that is augmented with quality indicators. An ER-based data quality requirements analysis methodology is proposed for specification of the kinds of quality indicator to be modeled.}

    abstract = { Abstract:Poor data quality (DQ) can have substantial social and economic impacts. Although firms are improving data quality with practical approaches and tools, their improvement efforts tend to focus narrowly on accuracy. We believe that data consumers have a much broader data quality conceptualization than IS professionals realize. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that captures the aspects of data quality that are important to data consumers.A two-stage survey and a two-phase sorting study were conducted to develop a hierarchical framework for organizing data quality dimensions. This framework captures dimensions of data quality that are important to data consumers. Intrinsic DQ denotes that data have quality in their own right. Contextual DQ highlights the requirement that data quality must be considered within the context ofthe task at hand. Representational DQ and accessibility DQ emphasize the importance of the role of systems. These findings are consistent with our understanding that high-quality data should be intrinsically good, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented, and accessible to the data consumer.Our framework has been used effectively in industry and government. Using this framework, IS managers were able to better understand and meet their data consumers’ data quality needs. The salient feature of this research study is that quality attributes of data are collected from data consumers instead of being defined theoretically or based on researchers’ experience. Although exploratory, this research provides a basis for future studies that measure data quality along the dimensions of this framework. }

They might, however, be the only forms of warranty data a manufacturer has, analysing such data are therefore needed and can also be of benefit to manufacturers in identifying early warnings of abnormalities in their products, providing useful information about failure modes to aid design modification, estimating product reliability for deciding on warranty policy, and forecasting future warranty claims needed for preparing warranty reserves plans. In last two decades, considerable research has been conducted in analysing coarse warranty data (CWD) from several different perspectives. This paper categorises different types of CWD and reviews techniques to analyse such data. It concludes with research needs in CWD.},

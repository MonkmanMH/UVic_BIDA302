## RStudio panes

## Console pane

R as calculator

```


## The power of named variables


## Creating a named object 

The assignment arrow `<-`

(or "<ALT> -")

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 4
```

> Did you notice the change in the Environment pane?


## x plus y

```{r}

x + y

```


# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

x <- 20

# And now divide `x` by `y`
x / y
